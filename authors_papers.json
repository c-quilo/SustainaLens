                "abstract": "Objective To explore the experiences of pregnancy, childbirth, antenatal and postnatal care in women belonging to ethnic minorities and to identify any specific challenges that these women faced during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Design This was a qualitative study using semistructured interviews of pregnant women or those who were 6 weeks postnatal from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. The study included 16 women in a predominantly urban Scottish health board area. Results The finding are presented in four themes: ‘communication’, ‘interactions with healthcare professionals’, ‘racism’ and ‘the pandemic effect’. Each theme had relevant subthemes. ‘Communication’ encompassed respect, accent bias, language barrier and cultural dissonance; ‘interactions with healthcare professionals’: continuity of care, empathy, informed decision making and dissonance with other healthcare systems; ‘racism’ was deemed to be institutional, interpersonal or internalised; and ‘the pandemic effect’ consisted of isolation, psychological impact and barriers to access of care. Conclusions This study provides insight into the specific challenges faced by ethnic minority women in pregnancy, which intersect with the unique problems posed by the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to potentially widen existing ethnic disparities in maternal outcomes and experiences of maternity care.",

                "title": "Associations between low Apgar scores and mortality by race in the United States: A cohort study of 6,809,653 infants",
                "abstract": "Background Apgar scores measure newborn health and are strongly associated with infant outcomes, but their performance has largely been determined in primarily white populations. Given the majority of the global population is not white, we aim to assess whether the association between low Apgar score and mortality in infants varies across racial groups. Methods and findings Population-based cohort study using 2016 to 2017 United States National Vital Statistics System data. The study included singleton infants born between 37 +0 and 44 +6 weeks to mothers over 15 years, without congenital abnormalities. We looked at 3 different mortality outcomes: (1) early neonatal mortality; (2) overall neonatal mortality; and (3) infant mortality. We used logistic regression to assess the association between Apgar score (categorized as low, intermediate, and normal) and each mortality outcome, and adjusted for gestational age, sex, maternal BMI, education, age, previous number of live births, and smoking status, and stratified these models by maternal race group (as self-reported on birth certificates). The cohort consisted of 6,809,653 infants (52.8% non-Hispanic white, 23.7% Hispanic, 13.8% non-Hispanic black, 6.6% non-Hispanic Asian, and 3.1% non-Hispanic other). A total of 6,728,829 (98.8%) infants had normal scores, 63,467 (0.9%) had intermediate scores, and 17,357 (0.3%) had low Apgar scores. Compared to infants with normal scores, low-scoring infants had increased odds of infant mortality. There was strong evidence that this association varied by race ( p &lt; 0.001) with adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of 54.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 49.9 to 59.4) in non-Hispanic white, 70.02 (95% CI 60.8 to 80.7) in Hispanic, 23.3 (95% CI 20.3 to 26.8) in non-Hispanic black, 100.4 (95% CI 74.5 to 135.4) in non-Hispanic Asian, and 26.8 (95% CI 19.8 to 36.3) in non-Hispanic other infants. The main limitation was missing data for some variables, due to using routinely collected data. Conclusions The association between Apgar scores and mortality varies across racial groups. Low Apgar scores are associated with mortality across racial groups captured by United States (US) records, but are worse at discriminating infants at risk of mortality for black and non-Hispanic non-Asian infants than for white infants. Apgar scores are useful clinical indicators and epidemiological tools; caution is required regarding racial differences in their applicability.",

                "abstract": "<ns3:p>Background Gestation at birth is associated with short and long-term outcomes. This study used high quality, national, administrative data to examine trends in gestation at birth in Scotland. Methods This observational study used maternity hospital discharge records for 2005 to 2019 to determine trends in the percentage of live births that were preterm (&lt;37 weeks gestation), term (37–41 weeks), and post-term (≥42 weeks), overall and by maternal age and deprivation category. Preterm births were further examined by category of preterm birth (moderate to late [32–36 weeks]; very [28–31 weeks]; extremely [&lt;28 weeks] preterm), and onset of labour (spontaneous; provider-initiated). Singleton and multiple births were examined separately. Aggregate logistic regression was used to estimate the annual change in the odds of a birth being in a specified gestational category. Results The percentage of singleton births in Scotland that were preterm decreased from 2005 (6.5%, 3,361/51,665) to 2010 (5.8%, 3268/56344), then increased to 2019 (7.2%, 3,408/47,507). The percentage of singleton births that were spontaneous moderate to late, very, and extremely preterm all increased between 2010 and 2019. The percentage of singleton births that were provider-initiated moderate to late preterm also increased between 2010 and 2019, however provider-initiated very or extremely preterm birth decreased. The percentage of singleton births that were preterm increased over time across all maternal age and deprivation categories, with increases greatest in groups at highest baseline risk. The percentage of singleton births that were post-term increased from 2005 to 2009, then decreased to 2019. Conclusions There has been an increase in spontaneous preterm birth from 2010 to 2019, which is not fully explained by changes in maternal age or deprivation. Further research to examine the contribution of other, preventable, risk factors is warranted. Trends in provider-initiated preterm birth, and post-term birth, are likely to reflect changing clinical practice.</ns3:p>",

Since the model should be accurate and fast, Reduced Order Modelling technique is used to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. The accuracy of the model, that represent a dynamic system, is improved integrating real data coming from sensors using Data Assimilation techniques. In this paper, we formulate a new methodology called Latent Assimilation that combines Data Assimilation and Machine Learning. We use a Convolutional neural network to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, a Long-Short-Term-Memory to build a surrogate model of the dynamic system and an Optimal Interpolated Kalman Filter to incorporate real data. Experimental results are provided for CO2 concentration within an indoor space. This methodology can be used for example to predict in real-time the load of virus, such as the SARS-COV-2, in the air by linking it to the concentration of CO2.",

Once the reduced-order model (ROM) of the CFD solution is obtained via PCA, an adversarial autoencoder is used on the principal components time series.

Once trained, the adversarially trained LSTM outperforms a LSTM trained in a classical way.

Even low odorants emissions without any health effects can derive in odor episodes, highly dependent on the changeable meteorology.PrOlor system is an environmental odor forecast system based in WRF/CALMET/CALPUFF models. WRF model settings includes four one-way nested grids, with 1x1 km2 horizontal resolution for the innermost grid, and initial and boundary conditions from GFS model forecast. CALMET horizontal resolution is 250x250 m2 to provide meteorological input to CALPUFF dispersion model.CALPUFF odorants dispersion modelling includes not only mixing, but also first order chemical decay. In addition, in order to estimate short odor events (minutes) from hourly CALPUFF concentrations peak-to-mean approach was adopted. Finally, chemical odorant peak concentrations were converted to odor intensity and odor concentration applying the Steven’s law.Traditionally, pulp paper mills using Kraft process produce TRS (Total Reduced Sulphur) odorants emissions, so their environment can be affected by odors. ENCE-Pontevedra pulp paper mill, located at the NW of the Iberian Peninsula, developed significant improvements to avoid any odor impact. Particularly, PrOlor system was developed and applied in order to prevent any odor event. Around the paper mill environment, both wind and temperature WRF and CALMET models results were compared and validated against four surface meteorological sites, using Openair software. About CALPUFF results, after several months under operation, PrOlor forecasted most of the sporadic short odor events registered as qualitative observations around the paper pulp mill.",

The forward and the inverse modellings are tested on two recent large wildfire events in California. Satellite observations are used to validate the forward prediction approach and identify the model parameters. By combining these forward and inverse approaches, the system manages to integrate real-time observations for parameter adjustment, leading to more accurate future predictions.",

                "abstract": "The scarcity of data presents a critical obstacle to the efficacy of medical visionlanguage pre-training (VLP). A potential solution lies in the combination of datasets from various language communities. Nevertheless, the main challenge stems from the complexity of integrating diverse syntax and semantics, language-specific medical terminology, and culture-specific implicit knowledge. Therefore, one crucial aspect to consider is the presence of community bias caused by different languages. This paper presents a novel framework named Unifying Cross-Lingual Medical Vision-Language Pre-Training (Med-UniC), designed to integrate multimodal medical data from the two most prevalent languages, English and Spanish. Specifically, we propose Cross-lingual Text Alignment Regularization (CTR) to explicitly unify cross-lingual semantic representations of medical reports originating from diverse language communities. CTR is optimized through latent language disentanglement, rendering our optimization objective to not depend on negative samples, thereby significantly mitigating the bias from determining positive-negative sample pairs within analogous medical reports. Furthermore, it ensures that the cross-lingual representation is not biased toward any specific language community. Med-UniC reaches superior performance across 5 medical image tasks and 10 datasets encompassing over 30 diseases, offering a versatile framework for unifying multi-modal medical data within diverse linguistic communities. The experimental outcomes highlight the presence of community bias in cross-lingual VLP. Reducing this bias enhances the performance not only in vision-language tasks but also in uni-modal visual tasks.",

Our two-step method integrates a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) based adversarial autoencoder (PC-AAE) with adversarial Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Once the reduced-order model (ROM) of the CFD solution is obtained via PCA, an adversarial autoencoder is used on the principal components time series. Subsequentially, a LSTM is adversarially trained on the latent space produced by the PC-AAE to make forecasts.

This study investigates the use of deep-learning methods for the accurate detection and measurement of droplet diameters and the image restoration of low-resolution images. This study demonstrates that the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides superior detection and reduced droplet diameter error measurement compared to the Circular Hough Transform, which is widely implemented and used in microfluidic imaging. SAM droplet detections prove to be more robust to image quality and microfluidic images with low contrast between the fluid phases. In addition, this work proves that a deep-learning super-resolution network MSRN-BAM can be trained on a dataset comprising of droplets in a flow-focusing microchannel to super-resolve images for scales ×2, ×4, ×6, ×8. Super-resolved images obtain comparable detection and segmentation results to those obtained using high-resolution images. Finally, the potential of deep learning in other computer vision tasks, such as denoising for microfluidic imaging, is shown. The results show that a DnCNN model can denoise effectively microfluidic images with additive Gaussian noise up to σ = 4.

We harnessed the UK's local ERA5 850 hPa temperature data and refined the U-STN12 global weather forecasting model, tailoring its predictions to the UK's climate nuances. From the ASOS network, we sourced T2m data, representing ground observations across the UK. We employed the advanced kriging method with a polynomial drift term for consistent spatial resolution. Furthermore, Gaussian noise was superimposed on the ERA5 T850 data, setting the stage for ensuing multi-time step synthetic observations. Probing into the assimilation impacts, the ASOS T2m data was integrated with the ERA5 T850 dataset. Our insights reveal that while global forecast models can adapt to specific regions, incorporating atmospheric data in DA significantly bolsters model accuracy. Conversely, the direct assimilation of surface temperature data tends to mitigate this enhancement, tempering the model's predictive prowess.",

The focus of this study is taken to be Taiwan, an area very vulnerable to typhoons. By comparing the performance of Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (CDDPM) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet), results suggest that the CDDPM performs best in generating accurate and realistic meteorological data. Specifically, CDDPM achieved a PSNR of 32.807, which is approximately 7.9% higher than CNN and 5.5% higher than SENet. Furthermore, CDDPM recorded an RMSE of 0.032, showing a 11.1% improvement over CNN and 8.6% improvement over SENet. A key application of this research can be for imputation purposes in missing meteorological datasets and generate additional high-quality meteorological data using satellite images.

The ability to accurately nowcast precipitation is therefore becoming more critical for safeguarding society by providing immediate, accurate information to decision makers. Motivated by the recent success of generative models at precipitation nowcasting, this paper: extends the DYffusion framework to this task and evaluates its performance at forecasting IMERG satellite precipitation data up to a 4-hour horizon; modifies the DYffusion framework to improve its ability to model rainfall data; and introduces a novel loss function that combines MSE, MAE and the LPIPS perceptual score. In a quantitative evaluation of forecasts up to a 4-hour horizon, the modified DYffusion framework trained with the novel loss outperforms four competitor models. It has the highest CSI scores for weak, moderate, and heavy rain thresholds and retains an LPIPS score $<$ 0.2 for the entire roll-out, degrading the least as lead-time increases. The proposed nowcasting model demonstrates visually stable and sharp forecasts up to a 2-hour horizon on a heavy rain case study. Code is available at https://github.com/Dseal95/DYffcast.",

As climate change intensifies the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, the need for accurate flood forecasting becomes even more urgent. This study focuses on Bangladesh, applying Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) architectures to predict flooding at a spatial resolution of approximately 2 km, using a straightforward set of publicly available satellite images. The objective is to explore whether machine learning can simplify flood prediction while expanding the coverage of existing models. The model produces pixel-level flood probability maps, showing promising results in predicting large-scale flooding with Area Under the Curve (AUC) values above 0.9 and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) scores exceeding 0.8. These outputs are both plausible and readily integrable into existing or new disaster response frameworks. As many regions remain underserved by flood prediction systems, this work lays the foundation for scalable machine learning applications that can help mitigate inequalities exacerbated by the increasing risk of flooding.",

This work leverages generative diffusion models to forecast cyclone trajectories and precipitation patterns by integrating satellite imaging, remote sensing, and atmospheric data. It employs a cascaded approach that incorporates three main tasks: forecasting, super-resolution, and precipitation modelling. The training dataset includes 51 cyclones from six major tropical cyclone basins from January 2019 - March 2023. Experiments demonstrate that the final forecasts from the cascaded models show accurate predictions up to a 36-hour rollout, with excellent Structural Similarity (SSIM) and Peak-Singal-To-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values exceeding 0.5 and 20 dB, respectively, for all three tasks. The 36-hour forecasts can be produced in as little as 30 mins on a single Nvidia A30/RTX 2080 Ti. This work also highlights the promising efficiency of Al methods such as diffusion models for high-performance needs in weather forecasting, such as tropical cyclone forecasting, while remaining computationally affordable, making them ideal for highly vulnerable regions with critical forecasting needs and financial limitations.

Visual self-supervised learning (vSSL), though effective for learning visual invariance, neglects the incorporation of domain knowledge from medicine. To incorporate medical knowledge into visual representation learning, vision-language pre-training (VLP) has shown promising results in 2D image. However, existing VLP approaches become generally impractical when applied to high-resolution 3D medical images due to GPU hardware constraints and the potential loss of critical details caused by downsampling, which is the intuitive solution to hardware constraints. To address the above limitations, we introduce T3D, the first VLP framework designed for high-resolution 3D medical images. T3D incorporates two text-informed pretext tasks: (\\lowerromannumeral{1}) text-informed contrastive learning; (\\lowerromannumeral{2}) text-informed image restoration. These tasks focus on learning 3D visual representations from high-resolution 3D medical images and integrating clinical knowledge from radiology reports, without distorting information through forced alignment of downsampled volumes with detailed anatomical text. Trained on a newly curated large-scale dataset of 3D medical images and radiology reports, T3D significantly outperforms current vSSL methods in tasks like organ and tumor segmentation, as well as disease classification. This underlines T3D's potential in representation learning for 3D medical image analysis. All data and code will be available upon acceptance.",

Thus, there is an urgent need to study the dynamics of epidemiological models to gain a better understanding of how such diseases spread. While epidemiological models can be computationally expensive, recent advances in machine learning techniques have given rise to neural networks with the ability to learn and predict complex dynamics at reduced computational costs. Here we introduce two digital twins of a SEIRS model applied to an idealised town. The SEIRS model has been modified to take account of spatial variation and, where possible, the model parameters are based on official virus spreading data from the UK. We compare predictions from a data-corrected Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network and a predictive Generative Adversarial Network. The predictions given by these two frameworks are accurate when compared to the original SEIRS model data. Additionally, these frameworks are data-agnostic and could be applied to towns, idealised or real, in the UK or in other countries. Also, more compartments could be included in the SEIRS model, in order to study more realistic epidemiological behaviour.",

Since the model should be accurate and fast, Reduced Order Modelling technique is used to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. The accuracy of the model, that represent a dynamic system, is improved integrating real data coming from sensors using Data Assimilation techniques. In this paper, we formulate a new methodology called Latent Assimilation that combines Data Assimilation and Machine Learning. We use a Convolutional neural network to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, a Long-Short-Term-Memory to build a surrogate model of the dynamic system and an Optimal Interpolated Kalman Filter to incorporate real data. Experimental results are provided for CO2 concentration within an indoor space. This methodology can be used for example to predict in real-time the load of virus, such as the SARS-COV-2, in the air by linking it to the concentration of CO2.",

Even low odorants emissions without any health effects can derive in odor episodes, highly dependent on the changeable meteorology.PrOlor system is an environmental odor forecast system based in WRF/CALMET/CALPUFF models. WRF model settings includes four one-way nested grids, with 1x1 km2 horizontal resolution for the innermost grid, and initial and boundary conditions from GFS model forecast. CALMET horizontal resolution is 250x250 m2 to provide meteorological input to CALPUFF dispersion model.CALPUFF odorants dispersion modelling includes not only mixing, but also first order chemical decay. In addition, in order to estimate short odor events (minutes) from hourly CALPUFF concentrations peak-to-mean approach was adopted. Finally, chemical odorant peak concentrations were converted to odor intensity and odor concentration applying the Steven’s law.Traditionally, pulp paper mills using Kraft process produce TRS (Total Reduced Sulphur) odorants emissions, so their environment can be affected by odors. ENCE-Pontevedra pulp paper mill, located at the NW of the Iberian Peninsula, developed significant improvements to avoid any odor impact. Particularly, PrOlor system was developed and applied in order to prevent any odor event. Around the paper mill environment, both wind and temperature WRF and CALMET models results were compared and validated against four surface meteorological sites, using Openair software. About CALPUFF results, after several months under operation, PrOlor forecasted most of the sporadic short odor events registered as qualitative observations around the paper pulp mill.",

The combination of meteorological signals and social media-based population density maps improved the performance and flexibility of our prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak in London.

One mechanism by which land use change influences biodiversity and ecological processes is through changes in the local climate. Here, the relationships between leaf area index and five climate variables - air temperature, relative humidity, vapour pressure deficit, specific humidity and soil temperature - are investigated across a range of land use types in Borneo, including primary tropical forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation. Strong correlations with the leaf area index are found for the mean daily maximum air and soil temperatures, the mean daily maximum vapour pressure deficit and the mean daily minimum relative humidity. Air beneath canopies with high leaf area index is cooler and has higher relative humidity during the day. Forest microclimate is also found to be less variable for sites with higher leaf area indices. Primary forest is found to be up to 2.5 °C cooler than logged forest and up to 6.5 °C cooler than oil palm plantations. Our results indicate that leaf area index is a useful parameter for predicting the effects of vegetation upon microclimate, which could be used to make small scale climate predictions based on remotely sensed data.",

The maximum height and the area of the TC wave footprint in the six h reanalysis have increased globally by about 3%/decade and 6%/decade, respectively. The TC wave energy transferred at the interface from the atmosphere to the ocean has increased globally by about 9%/decade, which is three times larger than that reported for all waves. The global energy changes are mostly driven by the growing area of the wave footprint. Our study shows that the TC-associated wave hazard has increased significantly and these changes are larger than those of the TC maximum wind speed. This suggests that the wave hazard should be a concern in the future.",

There are limited data on how such anomalies affect deaths from injuries. In the present study, we used data on mortality and temperature over 38 years (1980-2017) in the contiguous USA and formulated a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to quantify how anomalous temperatures, defined as deviations of monthly temperature from the local average monthly temperature over the entire analysis period, affect deaths from unintentional (transport, falls and drownings) and intentional (assault and suicide) injuries, by age group and sex. We found that a 1.5 °C anomalously warm year, as envisioned under the Paris Climate Agreement2, would be associated with an estimated 1,601 (95% credible interval 1,430-1,776) additional injury deaths. Of these additional deaths, 84% would occur in males, mostly in adolescence to middle age. These would comprise increases in deaths from drownings, transport, assault and suicide, offset partly by a decline in deaths from falls in older ages. The findings demonstrate the need for targeted interventions against injuries during periods of anomalously warm temperatures, especially as these episodes are likely to increase with global climate change.",

                "abstract": "Abstract. Compound flooding is generated when two or more flood drivers occur simultaneously or in close succession. Multiple drivers can amplify each other and lead to greater impacts than when they occur in isolation. A better understanding of the interdependence between flood drivers would facilitate a more accurate assessment of compound flood risk in coastal regions. This study employed the D-Flow Flexible Mesh model to simulate the historical peak coastal water level, consisting of the storm surge, astronomical tide, and relative sea level rise (RSLR), in Shanghai over the period 1961–2018. It then applies a copula-based methodology to calculate the joint probability of peak water level and rainfall during historical tropical cyclones (TCs) and to calculate the marginal contribution of each driver. The results indicate that the astronomical tide is the leading driver of peak water level, followed by the contribution of the storm surge. In the longer term, the RSLR has significantly amplified the peak water level. This study investigates the dependency of compound flood events in Shanghai on multiple drivers, which helps us to better understand compound floods and provides scientific references for flood risk management and for further studies. The framework developed in this study could be applied to other coastal cities that face the same constraint of unavailable water level records.",

RI in offshore regions is more threatening to coastal populations and economies. Although much effort has been devoted to studying basin-wide temporal-spatial fluctuations, variations of global RI events in offshore regions remain uncertain. Here, we show that compared with open oceans, where the annual RI counts do not show significant changes, offshore areas within 400 km of the coastline have experienced a significant increase in RI events, with the count tripling from 1980 to 2020. Furthermore, thermodynamic environments present more favorable conditions for this trend, and climate models show that global ocean warming has enhanced such changes. This work yields an important finding that an increasing threat of RI in coastal regions has occurred in the preceding decades, which may continue under a future warming climate.",

Synthetic tropical cyclone datasets can help overcome these problems. Here we present a new global dataset created by IRIS, the ImpeRIal college Storm model. IRIS is novel because, unlike other synthetic TC models, it only simulates the decay from the point of lifetime maximum intensity. This minimises the bias in the dataset. It takes input from 42 years of observed tropical cyclones and creates a 10,000 year synthetic dataset of wind speed which is then validated against the observations. IRIS captures important statistical characteristics of the observed data. The return periods of the landfall maximum wind speed are realistic globally.",

We do this, for the first time, by a applying a stochastic tropical cyclone event set generated by the Imperial College Storm Model to attribute the contribution of climate change to the case of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Compared to a pre‐industrial baseline, we estimate that a typhoon with a landfall maximum wind speed like Haiyan was larger by +3.5 m/s. This is in good agreement with previous full physics numerical model estimates. A Haiyan type of event has a current return period of 850 years, and the fractional attributable risk due to climate change is 98%. Without climate change, this event was very unlikely. The type of information available from the IRIS model could inform subsidizing of catastrophe bond yield in the context of the loss and damage fund.",

Two methods from recent literature are compared: linear (LC) and quantile‐quantile (QQ) corrections. An LC method is limited to correcting biases only in the distribution mean but retains all first‐order spatial and intervariable dependencies. Conversely, the QQ method corrects any bias in the distribution function but cannot retain intervariable dependencies and adds variability to smooth spatial fields. An RCM's boundary relaxation scheme dampens the effect of imbalanced variables but may not remove the spurious variability from the QQ method. Case study results of precipitation over a South African river catchment show that both correction methods improve RCM‐simulated monthly climatology, but the QQ correction creates a 20% bias in interannual monthly variability. We recommend the LC method as an effective bias correction for RCM inputs.",

For instantaneous rainrates and accumulations up to one hour, extreme rainfall scales with Clausius‐Clapeyron (CC) for temperatures below 24°C and at up to twice CC above 24°C. For longer accumulation periods and higher temperatures the scaling breaks down due to increased propagation of the squall line. For all periods, the storm average rainfall is found to scale at approximately 1.5 times CC over the entire range of temperatures.

The lack of a significant LI trend is caused by the much larger variance of LI than that of LMI in all basins and explains why a significant count change of TCs with major intensity at landfall has only now emerged. Basin-wide TC trends of intensity and spatial distribution have been reported, but this long-term major TC landfall count change may be the most socio-economic significant.",

The meteoroid with an initial mass of 22 kg entered the atmosphere with a low speed of 13.36 km s −1 and began a luminous trajectory at an altitude of 62.83 km. In maximum, it reached −9.6 absolute magnitude and terminated after a 5.7 s and 64.7 km long flight at an altitude of 29.59 km with a speed of 5.8 km s −1 . The angle of the atmospheric trajectory to the Earth’s surface was 30.9°. The first organized search took place in October 2008 and the first meteorite (150 g) was found 97 m southward from the predicted central line at the end of the first day of searching (October 3, 2008). The second stone (174 g) was recovered 39 m northward from the central line, both exactly in the predicted mass limits. During the second expedition in February 2009, a third fragment of 14.9 g was found again very close (∼100 m) from the predicted position. Total recovered mass is 339 g. The meteorite was designated Bunburra Rockhole (BR) after a nearby landscape structure. This first DFN sample is an igneous achondrite. Initial petrography indicated that BR was a brecciated eucrite but detailed analyses proved that BR is not a typical eucrite, but an anomalous basaltic meteorite ( Bland et al. 2009 ). BR was delivered from an unusual, Aten type orbit ( a &lt; 1 AU) where virtually the entire orbit was contained within Earth’s orbit. BR is the first achondrite fall with a known orbit and it is one of the most precise orbits ever calculated for a meteorite dropping fireball.",

Both model configurations have the same horizontal and vertical resolution in the ocean and the atmosphere, but differ in terms of model physics. The WPSH strongly modulates TC activity over the subtropical western North Pacific (WNP) and TC landfall over East Asia (Japan, Korea and East China). Here we show that both model configurations GA3 and GC2 show significant skill for predictions of the WPSH and TC variability over the subtropical WNP, as well as TC frequency along the coast of East Asia, during the boreal summer (June–August). An extension of the analysis to include the full WNP typhoon season (June–November) is also examined; however, only a weak significant relationship between the WPSH index and the observed TC frequency over East Asia is found during this period, and no significant relationship is present in either GloSea5 GA3 or GC2.

                "abstract": "Abstract Precipitation plays a crucial role in modulating upper-ocean salinity and the formation of the barrier layer, which affects the development of tropical cyclones (TCs). This study performed idealized simulations to investigate the influence of precipitation on the upper ocean. Precipitation acts to suppress the wind-induced sea surface reduction and generates an asymmetric warming response with a rightward bias. There is substantial vertical change with a cooling anomaly in the subsurface, which is about 3 times larger than the surface warming. The mean tropical cyclone heat potential is locally increased, but the net effect across the cyclone footprint is small. The impact of precipitation on the ocean tends to saturate for extreme precipitation, suggesting a nonlinear feedback. A prevailing driver of the model behavior is that the freshwater flux from precipitation strengthens the stratification and increases current shear in the upper ocean, trapping more kinetic energy in the surface layer and subsequently weakening near-inertial waves in the deep ocean. This study highlights the competing roles of TC precipitation and wind. Because the TC category is weaker than category 3, the warming anomaly is caused by reduced vertical mixing, whereas for stronger storms, the advection process is most important.",

                "abstract": "Abstract There are few observational and numerical studies of the summertime low‐level jet (LLJ) over the Persian Gulf, known as the shamal. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model accurately simulates the LLJ's vertical structure, nocturnal features and strong diurnal variation of the wind. The case‐study period is divided into a period during which the shamal is spatially extended (strong winds over the Gulf and Iraq) and a period during which it is less spatially extended (strong flow only over the Gulf). Orography, mountain slope and land/sea breeze are found to be key factors for the shamal diurnal variation of wind speed and wind direction; the Blackadar mechanism appears to be secondary to the heating in forcing the shamal. The Zagros Mountains not only channel the northwesterly winds but also provide a barrier for the easterly monsoon airflow, which maximizes the wind speed. Only during the less extensive period does the Zagros Mountains slope significantly affect the shamal wind intensity and direction. Both shallow and steep mountain slope sensitivity studies feature a jet‐like flow over the Persian Gulf. The steep slopes cause larger wind speeds; however, the shallow slopes reveal a stronger diurnally varying wind direction due to larger heating and cooling of the sloping terrain. It is also shown that, during the less extensive period, the land breeze and the lower friction over the sea increase the intensity of the nocturnal jet over the Gulf.

Notably, we combine the records from the Camborne and Reading sites to obtain a single ozone data series for southern England—a total duration of 30 years. Two‐section linear trends and cross‐over years are determined for Lerwick and southern England, both annually and seasonally. The observed minimum using this technique in the UK ozone record is found to occur during the year 1993. Significant trends of − 4.8% per decade for southern England and − 5.8% per decade for Lerwick are seen prior to the mid‐1990s; the rate of decrease in the UK being at the upper limit of other European stations. No significant ozone trend is seen for the latter period in either location in contrast with Europe as a whole. We, additionally, compare the satellite‐derived total ozone trends for both locations. The UV record at Reading showed a significant trend from 1993 to 2008 in the daily maximum UV index record (6.6% per decade), despite no significant recovery in the total ozone data series, suggesting a reduction in cloud cover during the midday period. Filtering data to remove other factors shows the erythemal UV to have an ozone‐dependent trend of − 0.11% per year, but this is not statistically significant. We find no correlation between anomalies in the surface UV and total ozone records suggesting that the majority of the inter‐annual variability is due to changes in cloud cover and other effects.

The different forcing mechanisms responsible for the seasonal variations of the plume extend are separately analyzed and the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) is employed to carry out both a process orientated study—with simple baseline simulations and a sensitivity study—with realistic 1 year runs setup in 2005. The baseline model is forced only by the river flow, in the presence of realistic bathymetry. Tides, wind stress, surface heat flux, and ocean boundary conditions are the forcing added to the realistic model. The typical seasonal orientation of the Congo River plume is found to be northward during most of year except for the February–March (FM) season when the plume has a large westward extension (about 800 km) and its area nearly doubles. The northward extension of the plume is explained by a buoyancy‐driven upstream coastal flow—due to the unique geomorphology of the Congo River estuary—and the combined influences of the ambient ocean currents and the wind. During the FM season, the surface ocean circulation is driving both (1) the westward extension of the plume and (2) the southward transport of the Nyanga River fresh waters which feed the Congo River plume. In the near‐field region of the plume, the presence of the deep Congo canyon has two main effects: (1) its depth increases the intrusion of sea water into the river mouth and (2) its orientation initiates the formation of the upstream flow.",

However, information about current and future hydro-climatic extremes is often not available. The Future Danube Model (FDM) is an end-user driven multi-hazard and risk model suite for the Danube region that has been developed to provide climate services related to perils such as heavy precipitation, heat waves, floods, and droughts under recent and scenario conditions. As a result, it provides spatially consistent information on extreme events and natural resources throughout the entire Danube catchment. It can be used to quantify climate risks, to support the implementation of the EU framework directives, for climate informed urban and land use planning, water resources management, and for climate proofing of large scale infrastructural planning including cost benefit analysis. The model suite consists of five individual and exchangeable modules: a weather and climate module, a hydrological module, a risk module, an adaptation module, and a web-based visualization module. They are linked in such a way that output from one module can either be used standalone or fed into subsequent modules. The utility of the tool has been tested by experts and stakeholders. The results show that more and more intense hydrological extremes are likely to occur under climate scenario conditions, e.g. higher order floods may occur more frequently.",

Over the past decades, the lifetime maximum intensity has increased, but there has also been a significant decrease in duration of time spent at intensities greater than Category 1. These compensating effects have maintained a stable global mean‐accumulated cyclone energy of individual major TCs. The global mean duration of major TCs has shortened by about 1 day from 1982 to 2018. There has been both faster intensification (Categories 1 to 3) and weakening (Categories 3 to 1) by about 40%. The probabilities of rapid intensification and rapid weakening have both risen in the period 2000–2018 compared to 1982–1999. A statistically significant anticorrelation is found between the lifetime maximum intensity and the following duration of the final weakening. This suggests an element of self‐regulation of TC life cycles.",

The control regional climate model simulation accurately represents the spatial and temporal pattern of observed precipitation and the upper atmospheric jet. From a simulation without the Caspian, it can be deduced that it causes a year‐round increase in evaporation and increases in precipitation in autumn and winter with little change in spring and summer. Over half of the over‐lake precipitation is attributable to the lake effect. These findings are confirmed through coupled simulation with a three‐dimensional lake model. The Caspian Sea's effect on surface air temperatures (an increase in winter and decrease in summer) causes an increase in cyclonicity in winter and anticyclonicity in spring and summer. These surface air temperature effects also penetrate higher up in the atmosphere, causing a perturbation of up to 25 m in the geopotential height at 200 hPa, leading to an increase in the maximum speed of the subtropical jet over western Asia during summer of 6.5%. An accurate description of the Caspian Sea in general circulation models is thus important for both local and regional climates.",

                "abstract": "Abstract. We designed a method to simulate atmospheric CO2 concentrations at several continuous observation sites around the globe using surface fluxes at a very high spatial resolution. The simulations presented in this study were performed using the Global Eulerian-Lagrangian Coupled Atmospheric model (GELCA), comprising a Lagrangian particle dispersion model coupled to a global atmospheric tracer transport model with prescribed global surface CO2 flux maps at a 1 × 1 km resolution. The surface fluxes used in the simulations were prepared by assembling the individual components of terrestrial, oceanic and fossil fuel CO2 fluxes. This experimental setup (i.e. a transport model running at a medium resolution, coupled to a high-resolution Lagrangian particle dispersion model together with global surface fluxes at a very high resolution), which was designed to represent high-frequency variations in atmospheric CO2 concentration, has not been reported at a global scale previously. Two sensitivity experiments were performed: (a) using the global transport model without coupling to the Lagrangian dispersion model, and (b) using the coupled model with a reduced resolution of surface fluxes, in order to evaluate the performance of Eulerian-Lagrangian coupling and the role of high-resolution fluxes in simulating high-frequency variations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. A correlation analysis between observed and simulated atmospheric CO2 concentrations at selected locations revealed that the inclusion of both Eulerian-Lagrangian coupling and high-resolution fluxes improves the high-frequency simulations of the model. The results highlight the potential of a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian model in simulating high-frequency atmospheric CO2 concentrations at many locations worldwide. The model performs well in representing observations of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at high spatial and temporal resolutions, especially for coastal sites and sites located close to sources of large anthropogenic emissions. While this study focused on simulations of CO2 concentrations, the model could be used for other atmospheric compounds with known estimated emissions.",

Although it has been found that the sea surface temperature and vertical wind shear can both make considerable changes to the hurricane destructive potential metrics, it is still unknown which plays a more important role. Here we present a new method to reconstruct the historical wind structure of hurricanes that allows us, for the first time, to calculate the correlation of damage with integrated power dissipation and integrated kinetic energy of all hurricanes at landfall since 1988. We find that those metrics, which include the horizontal wind structure, rather than just maximum intensity, are much better correlated with the hurricane cost. The vertical wind shear over the main development region of hurricanes plays a more dominant role than the sea surface temperature in controlling these metrics and therefore also ultimately the cost of hurricanes.",

                "abstract": "Abstract The Amazon and the Orinoco river plumes modulate ocean stratification and color in the tropical North Atlantic. This changes air‐sea interactions and may thus be important for tropical cyclones (TCs). Using a regional ocean model, we try to separate the potential impact of river freshwater and light absorption on ocean temperatures, stability, and TC intensity. While the freshwater plume stabilizes the water column, there is no significant change in sea surface temperatures. However, increased stability and temperature inversions may reduce surface cooling feedbacks. The cooling inhibition index (CI) is +2.2 (J/m 2 ) larger when the river freshwater plume is present. Ocean color in the river plume on the other hand, blocks the deeper ocean from sunlight, leading to moderate surface warming (+0.1°C) and substantial subsurface cooling (−0.3°C 100 m mean temperature). As a consequence cold water is more readily available to passing storms and the CI decreases by −2.1 (J/m 2 ) . Using simple, idealized relationships between expected surface cooling and TC intensity, we find that river‐induced stability enhances strong TCs by up to −5 to −12 hPa, while ocean color may reduce intensity by +8 hPa to +16 hPa. The net impact of the colored plume is negligible for weak storms and a slight intensity reduction for stronger cyclones. Within the Amazon and Orinoco plume, the river freshwater effect may thus be substantially reduced or even offset by light absorbing particles.",

Rooted in the classic description by Herbert Riehl, the mature stage is identified as the period from the time of lifetime maximum intensity to the time of lifetime maximum size. This study is the first to analyse the global climatology of the mature stage of tropical cyclones in detail. Three basic features at the mature stage are observed: the reduction of intensity, the outward expansion of the eyewall, and the increase of tangential wind in the outer primary circulation. Globally, about a quarter of tropical cyclones undergo the mature stage. High intensity at the end of the immature stage favours the likelihood of the occurrence of the mature stage. The intensity reduction during the mature stage is considerable with nearly three‐quarters of cyclones decreasing by more than 10%, which makes the conventional ‘steady‐state’ presumption questionable. The increase in the radius of damaging‐force wind is typically about 50 km, while the decrease in maximum wind speed is typically 20% at the mature stage. However, the average integrated kinetic energy and hence destructive potential increases substantially by about 70%. This is consistent with our finding that most of the highly damaging landfalling hurricanes undergo a mature stage. Intensity downgrades during the mature stage may be misinterpreted as they are mostly not accompanied by an overall danger reduction.",

A sensitivity simulation with no Congo flow shows that the river shallows the mixed layer by up to 7 m and creates barrier layers up to 6 m thick and temperature inversions of up to 0.5 K. Contrary to previous modeling studies, but in agreement with observational analysis, simulation results show no substantial SST signal from the Congo River in the eastern Atlantic. A cooling signal, K, is simulated in localized regions. A heat budget analysis shows that in these regions the cooling effect of reducing shortwave absorption within the mixed layer, by the shallowing of this layer, exceeds the warming impact of reducing vertical mixing. This is shown to be partly a consequence of the shallow mixed layer (10–15 m) in this region. The direct impact of the temperature of the Congo River input is confined to the region within of the river mouth.",

To test the λ model, an idealized full‐physics numerical model is employed to provide wind‐profile samples and also to show the influence of environmental temperature and the properties of initial vortices on tropical cyclone size. It is found that the λ model provides an accurate fit of the azimuthal wind profile at the top of the boundary layer. In the simulations, tropical cyclone size is sensitive to sea‐surface temperature, upper tropospheric temperature and initial vortex structure. The numerical model confirms the assumed Gaussian distribution with width λ of the moist entropy in the boundary layer. A linear relationship between model cyclone size and is found, in agreement with the λ model. The λ model predicts a weak relationship between tropical cyclone size and intensity, as is observed. In addition, the λ model suggests that change in tropical cyclone size should be closely related to angular momentum transport near the boundary layer, as has been found in observations. The good agreement of the λ model with the numerical model shows that the λ model could be a reasonable alternative for characterizing the wind structure of tropical cyclones with only one scaling parameter.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Climate change leads to sea level rise worldwide, as well as increases in the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones (TCs). Storm surge induced by TC’s, together with spring tides, threatens to cause failure of flood defenses, resulting in massive flooding in low-lying coastal areas. However, limited research has been done on the combined effects of the increasing intensity of TCs and sea level rise on the characteristics of coastal flooding due to the failure of sea dikes. This paper investigates the spatial variation of coastal flooding due to the failure of sea dikes subject to past and future TC climatology and sea level rise, via a case study of a low-lying deltaic city- Shanghai, China. Using a hydrodynamic model and a spectral wave model, storm tide and wave parameters were calculated as input for an empirical model of overtopping discharge rate. The results show that the change of storm climatology together with relative sea level rise (RSLR) largely exacerbates the coastal hazard for Shanghai in the future, in which RSLR is likely to have a larger effect than the TC climatology change on future coastal flooding in Shanghai. In addition, the coastal flood hazard will increase to a large extent in terms of the flood water volume for each corresponding given return period. The approach developed in this paper can also be utilized to investigate future flood risk for other low-lying coastal regions.",

TCs impact the ocean surface temperature by creating cold wakes as a “fingerprint”. Here we infer changes of the lifetime maximum intensity (LMI), size and integrated kinetic energy from the cold wakes for the period 1982–2019. We find a globally enhanced local cold wake amplitude 3 days after the LMI of − 0.12 ± 0.04 °C per decade whereas the cold wake size does not show any significant change. Multivariate regression models based on the observed ocean cooling, the TC translation speed and the ocean mixed layer depth are applied to infer LMI and TC size. The inferred annual mean global LMI has increased by 1.0 ± 0.7 m s −1 per decade. This inferred trend is between that found for two directly observed data sets. However, the TC size and the TC destructive potential measured by the integrated kinetic energy, have not altered significantly. This analysis provides new independent and indirect evidence of recent TC LMI increases, but a stable size and integrated kinetic energy.",

                "abstract": "Abstract The impact of dry midlevel air on the outer circulation of tropical cyclones is investigated in idealized simulations with and without a moist envelope protecting the inner core. It is found that a dry midlevel layer away from the cyclone center can broaden the outer primary circulation and thus the overall destructive potential at both developing and mature stages. The midlevel outer drying enhances the horizontal gradient of latent heating in the rainbands and drives the expansion of the outer circulation. The moist convection at large radii is suppressed rapidly after the midlevel air is dried in the outer rainbands. An enhanced horizontal gradient of latent heating initiates a radial–vertical overturning circulation anomaly in the rainbands. This anomalous overturning circulation accelerates the radial inflow of the main secondary circulation, increases the angular momentum import, and thus increases the cyclone size. The dry air, mixed into the boundary layer from the midtroposphere, is “recharged” by high enthalpy fluxes because of the increased thermodynamical disequilibrium above the sea surface. This recharge process protects the eyewall convection from the environmental dry-air ventilation. The proposed mechanism may explain the continuous expansion in the tropical cyclone outer circulation after maturity, as found in observations.",

Our observations of vertical momentum diffusivity support a superlinear relationship between diffusivity and wind speed at the high wind speeds in the inner-core of TCs (power-law exponent of 1.73 ± 0.20) while the few existing boundary layer hurricane observations in the North Atlantic suggest a more linear relationship.",

                "abstract": "Abstract It remains unclear how tropical cyclones (TCs) decay from their ocean lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) to landfall intensity (LI), yet this stage is of fundamental importance governing the socio-economic impact of TCs. Here we show that TCs decay on average by 25% from LMI to LI. A logistic decay model of energy production by ocean enthalpy input and surface dissipation by frictional drag, can physically connect the LMI to LI. The logistic model fits the observed intensity decay as well as an empirically exponential decay does, but with a clear physical foundation. The distance between locations of LMI and TC landfall is found to dominate the variability of the decay from the LMI to LI, whereas environmental conditions are generally less important. A major TC at landfall typically has a very large LMI close to land. The LMI depends on the heating by ocean warming, but the LMI location is also important to future landfall TC intensity changes which are of socio-economic importance.",

                "abstract": "Abstract There are simple conceptual models of tropical cyclone intensification and potential intensity. However, such a framework has been lacking to describe the evolution of the outer circulation. An analytic growth model of the tropical cyclone outer size is derived from the angular momentum equation. The growth model fits a full-physics idealized tropical cyclone simulation. The lifecycle composite of the best-track outer size growth shows a strong super-linear nature, which supports an exponential growth as predicted by the growth model. The climatology of outer size growth measured by the radius of gale-force wind in the North Atlantic and Eastern Pacific during the period 2004–2017, can be understood in terms of four growth factors of the model: the initial size, the growth duration, the mean growth latitude, and the mean top-of-boundary-layer effective local inflow angle. All four variables are significantly different between the two basins. The observed lifetime maximum size follows a lognormal distribution, which is in line with the law of the proportionate effect of this exponential growth model. The growth model fits the observed outer size well in global basins. The time constant of the exponential size growth is approximately equal to the product of the Coriolis parameter and the mean effective inflow angle above the boundary layer. Further sensitivity experiments with the growth model suggest that the interannual variability of the global lifetime maximum size is largely driven by the variation of growth duration.",

                "abstract": "Rapid intensification (RI) of tropical cyclones (TCs) provides a great challenge in operational forecasting and contributes significantly to the development of major TCs. RI is commonly defined as an increase in the maximum sustained surface wind speed beyond a certain threshold within 24 h. The most widely used threshold is 30 kt (15.4 m/s), which was determined statistically. Here we propose a new definition for RI by objectively clustering TCs using the intensification rate, initial intensity, and radius of the maximum wind speed. A group of 770 samples is separated at a threshold of 45 kt (23.2 m/s). The threshold is 40 kt (20.6 m/s) for the western North Atlantic, where TC size measurements are more reliable. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed threshold is robust even considering the uncertainty in RMW of as high as 30 km. We show that, when a TC undergoes RI, its maximum wind speed is approximately 60+/-15 kt (30.9+/-7.7 m/s) and the radius of the maximum wind speed is 45+/-20 km. The new threshold outperforms the conventional threshold of 30 kt/24h in (1) describing the bimodal distribution of lifetime maximum intensity, and (2) explaining the annual count of Category 5 TCs. This new definition provides a more physically-based threshold and describes a more reliable representation to the extreme events. Although more comparisons are needed for operational application, it is likely to be desirable for process-based case studies, and could provide a more valuable metric for TC intensification classification and research.",

High‐resolution numerical simulations of hurricane Catarina in the South Atlantic indicate that the TC size increases proportionally to the surface latent heat flux, when atmospheric and sea surface temperature ( SST ) are increased. The TC size is defined as the area enclosed by three wind thresholds: gale‐force winds, damaging‐force winds and hurricane‐force winds. The enlargement increases sharply with the wind threshold. Depending on the wind threshold, the area can increase by more than an order of magnitude when air and sea temperature are both increased by 2 °C. There is a clear linear relationship between the size increase and the latent heat flux during the TC lifetime. The size effect is driven initially by the enhanced air–sea moisture contrast and the surface winds become predominant only in the later stages. Temperature changes may therefore have a profound impact on cyclone size.",

We describe the first assimilation of such potential observations using idealized twin experiments with and without these observations. The data assimilation system consists of the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter and a coupled ocean‐atmosphere model. In this system, synthetic HF radar‐observed coastal currents are assimilated, and the 24‐, 48‐ and 72‐hr forecast performances are examined for TCs with various intensities, sizes, and translation speeds. Assimilating coastal surface currents improves the intensity forecast. The errors of the maximum wind speed reduce by 2.7 (33%) and 1.9 m/s (60%) in the 72‐hr forecast and 2.8 (40%) and 1.4 m/s (62%) in the 48‐hr forecast, for Category 4 and 2 cyclones, respectively. These improvements are similar to the current operational TC forecast errors, so that assimilating HF radar observations could be a substantial benefit.",

                "abstract": "Abstract It has been challenging to project the tropical cyclone (TC) intensity, structure and destructive potential changes in a warming climate. Here, we compare the sensitivities of TC intensity, size and destructive potential to sea surface warming with and without a pre-storm atmospheric adjustment to an idealized state of Radiative-Convective Equilibrium (RCE). Without RCE, we find large responses of TC intensity, size and destructive potential to sea surface temperature (SST) changes, which is in line with some previous studies. However, in an environment under RCE, the TC size is almost insensitive to SST changes, and the sensitivity of intensity is also much reduced to 3% °C −1 –4% °C −1 . Without the pre-storm RCE adjustment, the mean destructive potential measured by the integrated power dissipation increases by about 25% °C −1 during the mature stage. However, in an environment under RCE, the sensitivity of destructive potential to sea surface warming does not change significantly. Further analyses show that the reduced response of TC intensity and size to sea surface warming under RCE can be explained by the reduced thermodynamic disequilibrium between the air boundary layer and the sea surface due to the RCE adjustment. When conducting regional-scale sea surface warming experiments for TC case studies, without any RCE adjustment the TC response is likely to be unrealistically exaggerated. The TC intensity–temperature sensitivity under RCE is very similar to those found in coupled climate model simulations. This suggests global mean intensity projections under climate change can be understood in terms of a thermodynamic response to temperature with only a minor contribution from any changes in large-scale dynamics.",

The focus for improving predictions of rapid intensification has so far been on environmental conditions. Here we use the Coupled-Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport Modeling System to simulate tropical cyclones making landfall in South China: Nida (2016), Hato (2107) and Mangkhut (2018). Two smaller storms (Hato and Nida) undergo intensification, which is induced by the storms themselves through their extensive subsidence ahead of the storms, leading to clear skies and strong solar heating of the near-shore sea water over a shallow continental shelf. This heating provides latent heat to the storms, and subsequently intensification occurs. In contrast, such heating does not occur in the larger storm (Mangkhut) due to its widespread cloud cover. This results imply that to improve the prediction of tropical cyclone intensity changes prior to landfall, it is necessary to correctly simulate the short-term evolution of near-shore ocean conditions.",

Through a modeling study we show that, while the maximum wind speed is rapidly restored after the TC passes a warm‐ or cold‐ (eddy size) sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly, the storm size changes are more significant and persistent. The radius of gale force winds and integrated kinetic energy (IKE) can change by more than 10% per degree and this endures several days after crossing an SST anomaly. These properties have a long memory of the impact from the ocean fluxes and depend on the integrated history of SST exposure. They are found to be directly proportional to the storm total precipitation. Accurate continuous forecast of the SST along the track may therefore be of central importance to improving predictions of size and IKE, while instantaneous local SST near the TC core is more important for the forecast of maximum wind speed.",

A total of 642 TCs have been re-simulated using the new system to produce a climatology of TC intensity in the South China Sea. Detailed comparisons of the simulations from the atmosphere-only and the fully coupled systems reveal that the inclusion of the additional ocean and wave models enable differential sea surface temperature responses to various TC characteristics such as translational speed and size. In particular, interaction with the ocean does not necessarily imply a weakening of the TC, with the coastal bathymetry possibly playing a role in causing a near-shore intensification of the TC. These results suggest that to simulate the evolution of TC structure more accurately, it is essential to use an air-sea coupled model instead of an atmosphere-only model.",

Here, we document a recent trend of high thick clouds of TCs. The global inner‐core high thick cloud fraction measured by satellite has decreased from 2002 to 2021 by about 10% per decade. The TC inner‐core surface rain rate is also found to have decreased during the same period by a similar percentage. This suppression of high thick clouds and rain has been largest during the intensification phase of the strongest TCs. Hence, these two independent and consistent observations suggest that the TC inner‐core convection has weakened and that TCs have become shallower recently at least. For this period, the lifetime maximum intensity of major TCs has not changed and this suggests an increased efficiency of the spin‐up of TCs.",

Particularly, the surface wave interactions with the continental shelf and their impact on tropical cyclones have received very little attention. Through a series of state-of-the-art high-resolution, fully-coupled ocean-wave and atmosphere-ocean-wave experiments, we show here, for the first time, that in presence of continental shelf waves can cause substantial cooling of the sea surface. Through whitecapping there is a transfer of momentum from the surface which drives deeper vertical mixing. It is the waves and not just the wind which become the major driver of stratified coastal ocean ahead-of-cyclone cooling. In the fully-coupled atmosphere-ocean-wave model a negative feedback is found. The maximum wind speed is weaker and the damaging footprint area of hurricane-force winds is reduced by up to 50% due to the strong wave induced ocean cooling ahead. Including wave-ocean coupling is important to improve land falling tropical cyclone intensity predictions for the highly populated and vulnerable coasts.",

Examination of climate projections from multi‐model ensembles of monthly mean air temperatures suggest that the northern Caspian may be largely ice‐free by 2100 for the highest emission scenario. An ocean–ice–atmosphere model of the Caspian shows weak sensitivities of the minimum CFDD to varied sea ice albedo and ice compressive strength.

                "abstract": "Abstract A coupled ocean‐atmosphere‐wave model is used to investigate the sensitivity of surface wind speed and significant wave height to ocean temperature for idealized tropical cyclones (TCs). More intense and larger TCs, with higher waves, form when ocean temperature is increased. The maximum significant wave height increases more than the maximum wind speed for TCs up to hurricane force wind. However, above hurricane force wind the change in maximum wind speed is similar or greater than the change in maximum significant wave height. This can be explained by the wind drag coefficient decreasing as wind speed exceeds hurricane force wind, so that the growth of waves is dampened. The areal footprint of wave height grows considerably more than the maximum as ocean temperature is increased. This suggests a large increase in the surface area of damaging waves generated by TCs may be the dominant impact of a future warmer ocean.",

We examine a simple physically based decay model of maximum surface winds driven by frictional turbulent drag and a modification accounting for partial to complete land roughness. The model fits an algebraic decay with a parameter determined by the ratio of the surface drag coefficient to the effective vortex depth. This parameter has been decreasing from 1980 to 2018. There is also a global mean increase of wind speed 24 h after landfall of +1.13 m/s per decade. We cannot exclude the possibility that this trend is driven by the initial wind speed increase, but it is most likely due to a slowing of the decay. This weaker decay amounts to an additional 7 h of gale force winds for a typical Category 1 at landfall.",

We develop a new model of TC central pressure tendency where the pressure change can be expressed as exponential with a time constant determined by the ratio of radius maximum wind ( R max ) and the column inflow or outflow speed. An analysis of observations confirms the relationship which becomes more important for a larger pressure tendency and suggests an upper bound on pressure tendency for a given R max .

In a pilot attempt we assimilate this data into a coastal ocean model (ROMS) using variational assimilation and, for the first time, investigate the impact on the simulation of a major river plume (the Congo River). Four experiments were undertaken consisting of a control (without data assimilation) and the assimilation of either sea surface height (SSH), SMOS and the combination of both, SMOS SSH. Several metrics specific to the plume were utilised, including the area of the plume, distance to the centre of mass, orientation and average salinity. The assimilation of SMOS and combined SMOS SSH consistently produced the best results in the plume analysis. Argo float salinity profiles provided independent verification of the forecast. The SMOS or SMOS SSH forecast produced the closest agreement for Argo profiles over the whole domain (outside and inside the plume) for three of four months analysed, improving over the control and a persistence baseline. The number of samples of Argo floats determined to be inside the plume were limited. Nevertheless, for the limited plume-detected floats the largest improvements were found for the SMOS or SMOS SSH forecast for two of the four months.",

                "abstract": "Across-slope bottom boundary layer (BBL) fluxes on the shelf-edge connect this region to deeper waters. Two proposed ways in which across-slope BBL fluxes can occur, in regions that have a slope current aligned to the bathymetry, are the frictional veering of bottom currents termed the ‘Ekman drain’ and through local wind-forced downwelling (wind-driven surface Ekman flow with an associated bottom flow). We investigate the variability, magnitude and spatial scale of BBL fluxes on the Shetland shelf, which has a prominent slope current, using a high-resolution (∼2 km) configuration of the MITgcm model. Fluxes are analysed in the BBL at the shelf break near the 200 m isobath and are found to have a seasonal variability with high/low volume transport in winter/summer respectively. By using a multivariate regression approach, we find that the locally wind-driven Ekman transport plays no explicit role in explaining daily bottom fluxes. We can better explain the variability of the across-slope BBL flux as a linear function of the speed and across-slope component of the interior flow, corresponding to an Ekman plus mean-flow flux. We estimate that the mean-flow is a greater contributor than the Ekman flux to the BBL flux. The spatial heterogeneity of the BBL fluxes can be attributed to the mean-flow, which has a much shorter decorrelation length compared to the Ekman flux. We conclude that both the speed and direction of the interior current determines the daily BBL flux. The wind does not explicitly contribute through local downwelling, but may influence the interior current and therefore implicitly the BBL fluxes on longer timescales.",

This demonstrates the potential for conducting erosion prediction studies using a regional climate model. Soil erosion is already a major global problem, and there is growing pressure on our land to deliver food and stability. Rainfall kinetic energy flux is an important variable in erosion prediction but is generally parameterized from intensity due to measurement difficulties. We show that a cloud resolving model can be used to dynamically simulate the kinetic energy of rain from basic physics, using four microphysics schemes. Results are within the range of observations and also capture the observed variability in kinetic energy for a given intensity. Large drops are shown to contribute disproportionately to total kinetic energy compared with their number, suggesting that several existing relations between terminal velocity and size of raindrops are poorly suited for kinetic energy modeling.",

A large‐scale OLR dipole pattern of low and high fluxes are found in both the observations and model. As expected, a low OLR region is positioned within the TC circulation, but there is also a robust high OLR region poleward and west of the TC centre. A dry “black hole” on WV grey‐scale imagery occupies the same region of high OLR. Relative to the central low OLR TC signal, the typical dipole magnitude, distance and orientation of the high OLR regions are 230 W·m −2 , 1,150 km, and 145° anticlockwise from east. From the reanalysis we find that the interaction between the vortex and the environmental flows produces upper‐level convergence, low‐level divergence and subsidence throughout the troposphere in the region of high OLR. Analysis of the ECMWF model shows that the position of the high OLR region rotates anticlockwise about the TC centre as the TC moves from westward to eastward. Through use of a sub‐ensemble, we test if capturing the high OLR anomaly has a significant relationship with TC track. We apply a perfect model approach and find that sub‐ensembles that are composed of models whose large‐scale OLR fields closely match the target TC also have a better track. This improvement is mostly attributed to the high OLR component of the dipole.",

Starting from the axisymmetric mass continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates, we derive that the half-life of the decay of the pressure deficit between the environment and TC center is proportional to the initial radius of maximum surface wind speed. The initial pressure deficit and column-mean radial inflow speed into the core are the other key variables. The assumptions made in deriving the model are validated against idealized numerical simulations of TC decay over land. Decay half-lives predicted from a range of initial TC states are tested against the idealized simulations and are in good agreement. Dry idealized TC decay simulations show that without latent convective heating, the boundary layer decouples from the vortex above leading to a fast decay of surface winds while a midlevel vortex persists.",

                "abstract": "The seasonal response of upper ocean processes in the Red Sea to summer-time dust aerosol perturbations is investigated using an uncoupled regional ocean model. We find that the upper limit response is highly sensitive to dust-induced reductions in radiative fluxes. Sea surface cooling of −1°C and −2°C is predicted in the northern and southern regions, respectively. This cooling is associated with a net radiation reduction of −40 W m−2 and −90 W m−2 over the northern and southern regions, respectively. Larger cooling occurs below the mixed layer at 75 m in autumn, −1.2°C (north) and −1.9°C (south). SSTs adjust more rapidly (ca. 30 days) than the subsurface temperatures (seasonal time scales), due to stronger stratification and increased mixed layer stability inhibiting the extent of vertical mixing. The basin average annual heat flux reverses sign and becomes positive, +4.2 W m−2 (as compared to observed estimates −17.3 W m−2) indicating a small gain of heat from the atmosphere. When we consider missing feedbacks from atmospheric processes in our uncoupled experiment, we postulate that the magnitude of cooling and the time scales for adjustment will be much less, and that the annual heat flux will not reverse sign but nevertheless be reduced as a result of dust perturbations. While our study highlights the importance of considering coupled ocean-atmosphere processes on the net surface energy flux in dust perturbation studies, the results of our uncoupled dust experiment still provide an upper limit estimate of the response of the upper ocean to dust-induced radiative forcing perturbations.",

Here, we analyse observations of landfalling tropical cyclones in South China and of subsurface ocean temperatures in the Pacific warm pool region, and identify the possibility of forecasts of South China tropical cyclone landfall a year ahead. Specifically, we define a subsurface temperature index, subNiño4, and build a predictive model based on subNiño4 anomalies with a robust double cross-validated forecast skill against climatology of 23%, similar in skill to existing forecasts issued much later in the spring. We suggest that subNiño4 ocean temperatures precede the surface El Niño/Southern Oscillation state by about 12 months, and that the zonal shifts in atmospheric heating then change mid-level winds to steer tropical cyclones towards landfall in South China. We note that regional subsurface ocean temperature anomalies may permit atmospheric predictions in other locations at a longer range than is currently thought possible.",

Here, we propose the use of empirical orthogonal functions as an approach to understand model bias of TCG. Two leading modes of large‐scale wind circulations in the West Pacific can explain the TCG frequency and location in both climate reanalysis and the MetUM model. In the reanalysis, the two modes distinguish the summer monsoon trough position and the strength of the north Pacific subtropical high. However, in the model, the wind circulations are biased toward the positive phase of simulated modes thus overestimating TCG in the entire Main Development Region. This bias is further related to the north‐eastward shifted monsoon trough and a weakened subtropical high, and overly strong tropics‐subtropics connections. This approach could be deployed more widely to other basins and models to diagnose the causes of TCG bias.",

ERA5 reanalysis is a benchmark data set for tropical cyclone studies, yet the maximum wind speed error is very large (68 kts) and is still 19 kts after simple linear correction, even in the better sampled North Atlantic. Here, we develop an adaptive learning approach to correct the intensity in the ERA5 reanalysis, by optimising the inputs to overcome the problems caused by the poor data quality and updating the features to improve the generalisability of the deep learning-based model. Specifically, we use understanding of TC properties to increase the representativeness of the inputs so that the general features can be learned with deep neural networks in the sample space, and then use domain adaptation to update the general features from the known domain with historical storms to the specific features for the unknown domain of new storms. This approach can reduce the error to only 6 kts which is within the uncertainty of the best track data in the international best track archive for climate stewardship (IBTrACS) in the North Atlantic. The method may have wide applicability, such as when extending it to the correction of intensity estimation from satellite imagery and intensity prediction from dynamical models.",

                "abstract": "A mechanism leading to the self‐weakening of tropical cyclones is proposed using the Weather and Research and Forecasting model. A comparison between an experiment with variable Coriolis parameter f and one on an f ‐plane shows that, after the initial intensification, the former is characterized by a smaller intensity. As opposed to the tropical cyclone on the f ‐plane, the one with variable f weakens significantly after reaching maturity. Analyses of the 3D circulation show that the main reason for the weakening is dry intrusion in the mid‐upper troposphere from the west. Once the dry intrusion reaches the inner vortex, strong downdraughts reduce the high equivalent potential temperature in the boundary‐layer inflow. The subsequent updraughts in the eyewall, characterized by lower equivalent potential temperature, are considerably reduced and, consequently, the secondary circulation weakens. Back‐trajectories are used to determine the origin of the dry intrusion. It is found that the air parcels expelled from the storm deep convection into the outflow layer recirculate anticyclonically back into the vortex, causing a self‐weakening of the tropical cyclone. A time span for the recirculation of at least 48 h allows the air parcels to sink substantially before reaching the vortex circulation. Some implications of the intrinsic nature of this process are briefly discussed.",

The simulation shows a more complex structure of the deep flow field than previously thought: a flow reversal of the deep and intermediate waters to the northeast on the Faroese flank of the channel and persistent topographic eddies that force the deep currents into a gyre‐like structure. This flow reversal opposes the previously accepted understanding of a purely southwestward deep flow but is in agreement with velocity measurements. The southwestward transport of the overflow waters is found to be facilitated almost exclusively by a strong and narrow current on the Shetland side of the channel. Float release experiments show that up to 38% of the overflow water takes longer than a purely southwestward flow regime suggests and up to 13% takes twice as long. From the release of tracers, a substantial amount of lateral mixing is evident within the channel, predominantly facilitated by the topographic eddies.",

This study quantifies the progressive upwind shift of the wavenumber‐1 maximum rain position with radius relative to the vertical wind shear direction. This shift is visualized as a distinctive upwind spiral of the maximum. It is shown that this spiral pattern is generally observed across various storm intensities, shear strength, and ocean basins. Detailed examination revealed that the maximum downwind deflection angle of the wavenumber‐1 rain maximum relative to the shear direction is smaller for tropical storms than hurricanes, but insensitive to hurricane intensity. It is proposed that the spirality is produced by a continuous decline in angular advection of air parcels with radius. The stability of the deflection angle in hurricanes may be accounted for by a corresponding increase in vertical ascent under strengthening angular flow.",

                "abstract": "Abstract It is projected that the sea surface temperature (SST) increases under climate change and enhances tropical cyclone (TC) intensification directly. An opposing expected feature of climate change is the strengthening atmospheric static stability, which may suppress intensification. The intensity and diabatic heating are closely related through the secondary circulation, but it has been unclear whether both will change at the same rate. Here we show that they respond differently to stability changes. The efficiency of converting diabatic heating to kinetic energy (KE) of TCs to SST and static stability during the intensification stage is examined. In a set of idealised simulations, the efficiency does not have a significant relation with the SST. However the efficiency is found to decrease with increasing static stability at a rate of about K. It is shown that the KE increment declines, while the diabatic heating in the eyewall remains unchanged with larger static stability. The decrease in KE gain at the eyewall is associated with an enhanced outward advection of absolute angular momentum. The combined effect of enhanced water‐vapour supply and the slightly reduced updraft at the eyewall keeps the diabatic heating steady with varying static stability. This study demonstrates the complex effects of enhanced static stability, which is expected to accompany surface warming, on tropical cyclones.",

The high skill in predicting the number of TCs is due to the ability to predict multi-annual-to-multi-decadal trends and variability in the number of TCs associated with the temporal evolution of surface temperature and vertical wind shear in these two ocean basins. This is further related to the simulation of the externally forced response, with internal climate variability also allowing the improvement of the prediction skill. We applied a signal-to-noise calibration framework to further increase the skill of the TC decadal prediction. The decadal skill in predicting the number of TCs over the eastern Pacific and tropical Atlantic Ocean can be up to ACC = 0.93 and ACC = 0.83, retrospectively (measured by the Anomaly Coefficient Correlation—ACC). DePreSys4 predicts that the number of TCs will increase in the next decade (2023–2030) over the eastern Pacific and the tropical Atlantic Ocean, potentially leading to high economic losses.",

This study examines sources of predictability for the number of landfalling typhoons in East China on seasonal (June–October) and sub‐seasonal time scales. East China landfall count is shown to be independent of basin‐scale properties of TC tracks, such the genesis location, duration, basin track direction and length, and basin total count. Large‐scale environmental climate indices which are potential basin scale drivers are also shown to be largely uncorrelated with landfall prior to and throughout the season. The most important factor is the steering in the final stages to landfall. The seasonal landfall is strongly anti‐correlated with the more local zonal mid‐tropospheric wind field over the East China sea ( r = −.61, p &lt; .001). It is proposed that geopotential height anomalies over Korea/Japan cause anomalous easterly winds in the East China Sea and enhance landfall rates by steering typhoons onto the coast. Early, peak, and late sub‐seasonal landfall counts are shown to be independent of each other yet share this predictor. This local feature may be dynamically predictable allowing a potential hybrid dynamical‐statistical seasonal forecast of landfall.",

Here, a new rainfall scheme is introduced into the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) to incorporate the effects of precipitation mass. When precipitation is added to the sea surface, it spreads out via surface gravity waves that increase in propagation speed with increasing water depth. Over several days, the SSH increase due to the precipitation mass added creates a geostrophic adjustment, generating anticyclonic geostrophic currents around the SSH increase. The transfer of momentum from precipitation to the sea surface, or rain stress, can also be important. In the case‐study of a real tropical cyclone, Monica, passing North Australia, the effect of incorporating precipitation mass is compared with other processes affecting the storm surge: surface wind, inverse barometer effect and rain stress. The maximum SSH response is 170.6 cm for the wind effect, 61.5 cm for the inverse barometer effect, 7.5 cm for the effect of rain stress and 6.4 cm for the effect of rain mass. Each process has been shown to have different spatial influences. The effect of rain mass has a strong remote influence compared to the inverse barometer effect and the effect of rain stress.

                "abstract": "Abstract Smoothing of generation variability, i.e. reduction of variance in the aggregate generation is crucial for grid integration of large-scale wind power plants. Prior studies of smoothing have focused on geographical smoothing, based on distance. In contrast, we propose a novel concept ‘diurnal smoothing’ that depends on spatial variations in the timing of seasonal-mean diurnal cycle peak. Considering the case of India, which experiences a strong diurnal cycle of wind-speed, we show how spatial heterogeneity in the wind diurnal cycle can be exploited to smooth wind power variability over and above geographical smoothing. For any given separation distance between sites, the hourly wind speed correlation is highly variable. Difference in timing of the diurnal cycle peak is an important factor for explaining this variability and we define smoothing from differently timed seasonal-mean diurnal cycle as ‘diurnal smoothing’. We show that apart from separation distance, the diurnal cycle is crucial for correlation among sites separated by 200 km or more with strong diurnal cycles (amplitude more than approximately 0.5 m s −1 ). Thus, diurnal smoothing is a vital factor in the aggregation of large wind power plants, and grid integration is benefited by considering (in addition to distance) new wind plant sites with largely separated diurnal cycles, especially those differing by roughly 12 h. Such diurnal smoothing is relevant for regions across the world with strong wind speed diurnal cycles. Ultimately grid integration depends on variations in total wind and solar generation and demand. Hence, their combined effects must be studied.",

Increased atmospheric aerosol concentrations tend to suppress precipitation in warm rain clouds, while in cold or mixed-phase systems, invigoration of surface rainfall can occur. We show that in both these cases, the response of erosivity to an increase in aerosol is in the same direction as, but amplified beyond the change in total rainfall. We also show that aerosols can impact erosivity through changes in raindrop size. Our results suggest that anthropogenic aerosol emissions affect erosivity and thus may have important consequences for agricultural productivity.",

The Caspian Sea can be seen as a virtual laboratory—a compromise between realistic global models that are hampered by long equilibration times and idealized basin geometry models, which are not constrained by observations. We find that increases in vertical mixing drive stronger thermally direct overturning and consequent conversion of available potential to kinetic energy. Numerical solutions with water mass structures closest to observations overturn 0.02–0.04 × 10 6 m 3 /s (sverdrup) representing the first estimate of Caspian Sea overturning. Our results also suggest that the overturning is thermally forced increasing in intensity with increasing vertical diffusivity. Finally, stronger thermally direct overturning is associated with a stronger horizontal circulation in the Caspian Sea. This suggests that the ocean's heat engine can strongly impact broader horizontal circulations in the ocean.",

In this study, we showcase the impact of strongly coupled data assimilation with hypothetical ocean currents on analyses and forecasts of Typhoon Hato (2017). Several observation simulation system experiments (OSSE) were undertaken with a regional coupled ocean–atmosphere model. We assimilated combinations of (or individually) a hypothetical coastal current HF radar network, a dense array of drifter floats, and minimum sea level pressure. During the assimilation, instant updates of many important atmospheric variables (winds and pressure) are achieved from the assimilation of ocean current observations using the cross-domain error covariance, significantly improving the track and intensity analysis of Typhoon Hato. Relative to a control experiment (with no assimilation), the error of minimum pressure decreased by up to 13 hPa (4 hPa/57% on average). The maximum wind speed error decreased by up to 18 kt (5 kt/41% on average) (1 kt ≈ 0.5 m s −1 ). By contrast, weakly coupled implementations cannot match these reductions (10% on average). Although traditional atmospheric observations were not assimilated, such improvements indicate that there is considerable potential in assimilating ocean currents from coastal HF radar and surface drifters within a strongly coupled framework for intense landfalling TCs.",

However, their relative importance to TC surge at landfall remains unknown. Here we examine the sensitivity of TC surge in Shanghai to landfall location and intensity with a new dynamical modelling framework. We find a surge sensitivity of 0.8 m (°N) −1 to landfall location, and 0.1 m (m s −1 ) −1 to wind speed in Shanghai during landfall. The landfall location and intensity are comparably important to surge variation. However, based on a plausible range of reported trends of TC poleward migration and intensity, the potential surge hazard due to poleward migration is estimated to be about three times larger than that by intensity change. The long‐term surge risk in Shanghai is therefore substantially more sensitive to changes of TC track and landfall location than intensity. This may also be true elsewhere and in the future.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Flood hazard is a function of the magnitude and spatial pattern of precipitation accumulation. The sensitivity of precipitation to atmospheric temperature is investigated for idealized extratropical cyclones, enabling us to examine the footprint of extreme precipitation (surface area where accumulated precipitation exceeds high thresholds) and the accumulation in different‐sized catchment areas. The mean precipitation increases with temperature, with the mean increase at 5.40%/°C. The 99.9th percentile of accumulated precipitation increases at 12.7%/°C for 1 h and 9.38%/°C for 24 h, both greater than Clausius‐Clapeyron scaling. The footprint of extreme precipitation grows considerably with temperature, with the relative increase generally greater for longer durations. The sensitivity of the footprint of extreme precipitation is generally super Clausius‐Clapeyron. The surface area of all precipitation shrinks with increasing temperature. Greater relative changes in the number of catchment areas exceeding extreme total precipitation are found when the domain is divided into larger rather than smaller catchment areas. This indicates that fluvial flooding may increase faster than pluvial flooding from extratropical cyclones in a warming world. When the catchment areas are ranked in order of total precipitation, the 99.9th percentile is found to increase slightly above Clausius‐Clapeyron expectations for all of the catchment sizes, from 9 km 2 to 22,500 km 2 . This is surprising for larger catchment areas given the change in mean precipitation. We propose that this is due to spatially concentrated changes in extreme precipitation in the occluded front.",

In this study, idealized experiments of a tropical cyclone forcing a 3D ocean model are conducted to investigate the asymmetry of positive and negative surges. Negative surges are larger in magnitude and extend further across the coastline than positive surges. While positive surges are driven by wind blowing onshore, negative surges are largely dominated by alongshore winds, with horizontal divergence as the main mechanism. This asymmetry also increases with decreasing depth and increasing latitude.",

                "abstract": "Tropical cyclones (TC) are dangerous weather events and accurate monitoring and forecasting can provide significant early warning to reduce loss of life and property. However, the study of tropical cyclone intensity remains challenging, both in terms of theory and forecasting. ERA5 reanalysis is benchmark data set for tropical cyclone studies, yet the maximum wind speed error is very large (68 kts) and still 19 kts after simple linear correction even in the better sampled North Atlantic. Here, we develop an adaptive learning approach to correct the intensity in the ERA5 reanalysis, by optimising the inputs to overcome the problems because of the poor data quality and updating the features to improve the generalisability of the deep learning-based model. Specifically, we use TC knowledge to increase the representativeness of the inputs so that the general features can be learned with deep neural networks in the sample space, and then use domain adaptation to update the general features from the known domain with historical storms to the specific features for the unknown domain of new storms. This approach can reduce the error to only 6 kts which is within the uncertainty of the best track data in IBTrACS in the North Atlantic. The method may have wide applicability, such as extending it to the correction of intensity estimation from satellite imagery and intensity prediction from dynamical models.",

                "abstract": "Abstract. Compound flooding is generated when two or more flood drivers occur simultaneously or in close succession. Multiple drivers can amplify each other and lead to greater impacts than when they occur in isolation. A better understanding of the interdependence between flood drivers will facilitate a more accurate assessment of compound flood risk in the coastal regions. This study employed the Delft3D-Flow Flexible Mesh model to simulate the peak coastal water level, consisting of storm surge, astronomical tide, and the relative sea level rise (RSLR) in Shanghai over 1961–2018. It then applies a copula-based methodology to calculate the joint probability of peak water level and rainfall during historical tropical cyclones (TCs) and to calculate the marginal contribution of each driver. The results indicate that the astronomic tide is the leading driver to peak water level, followed by the contribution of storm surge. In a longer term, the RSLR has significantly amplified the peak water level. This framework could be applied to other coastal cities which face the similar constraint of unavailable water level records.",

                "abstract": "Abstract. We designed a method to simulate atmospheric CO2 concentrations at several continuous observation sites around the globe using surface fluxes at a very high spatial resolution. The simulations presented in this study were performed using a Lagrangian particle dispersion model coupled to a global atmospheric tracer transport model with prescribed global surface CO2 flux maps at a 1 × 1 km resolution. The surface fluxes used in the simulations were prepared by assembling the individual components of terrestrial, oceanic and fossil fuel CO2 fluxes. This experimental setup (i.e., a transport model running at a medium resolution, coupled to a high-resolution Lagrangian particle dispersion model together with global surface fluxes at a very high resolution), which was designed to represent high-frequency variations in atmospheric CO2 concentration, has not been reported at a global scale previously. Two sensitivity experiments were performed: (a) using the global transport model without coupling to the Lagrangian dispersion model, and (b) using the coupled model with a reduced resolution of surface fluxes, in order to evaluate the performance of Eulerian-Lagrangian coupling and the role of high-resolution fluxes in simulating high-frequency variations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. A correlation analysis between observed and simulated atmospheric CO2 concentrations at selected locations revealed that the inclusion of both Eulerian-Lagrangian coupling and high-resolution fluxes improves the high-frequency simulations of the model. The results highlight the potential of a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian model in simulating high-frequency atmospheric CO2 concentrations at many locations worldwide. The model performs well in representing observations of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at high spatial and temporal resolutions, especially for coastal sites and sites located close to sources of large anthropogenic emissions. While this study focused on simulations of CO2 concentrations, the model could be used for other atmospheric compounds with known estimated emissions.",

As an example, the average crossover time calculated using the Lagrangian separation distance (the distance between simulated trajectories and observed drifters) for the global MERCATOR ocean model analysis is found to be about 6 days. Conversely, the model forecast has an average crossover time longer than 6 days, suggesting limited skill in Lagrangian predictability by the current generation of global ocean models. The crossover time of the velocity error is less than 3 days, which is similar to the average decorrelation time of the observed drifters. The crossover time is a useful measure to quantify future ocean model improvements.",

                "abstract": "BackgroundExtreme temperatures which deviate from long-term averages will be more frequent as the global climate changes, and could have adverse health consequences. Much previous work has focussed on how mortality from natural causes is affected by daily or multi-day hot/cold episodes, and not on weather patterns that reflect inter-annual variations, as expected under global climate change, nor on injuries.MethodsWe formulated a Bayesian spatiotemporal model to estimate how deviations from long-term averages of mean monthly temperature as well as number of monthly extremes affect injury mortality in the contiguous USA. Our model incorporates how mortality varies by age, sex, state of residence, and month and year. Importantly, it associates monthly injury death rate to inter-annual variation of temperature from the average 30-year climate.We calculated injury death rates for each age group, sex, state and year from national vital statistics over a 34-year period (1980 to 2013) and monthly population-weighted temperature statistics from the ERA-Interim project, which combines predictions of a physical model with ground-based and satellite measurements.ResultsRisk of dying from unintentional injuries increased in anomalously-warm June/July months in males, up to 1.8% (95% CI 1.2 – 2.5) per degree Celsius in July. Males ≤55 years were also at increased risk throughout spring and summer months, by up to 2.0% (1.0 – 3.2) in May. Only females 5-24 years were at increased risk in anomalously-warm months, and only in summer months. Intentional injuries showed no consistent relationship with anomalous temperatures. We will also show findings on transport accidents, accidental falls, accidental drowning, self-harm and assault.ConclusionMore frequent or extreme anomalously-warm months will increase mortality for unintentional injuries in spring and summer months for males. There will be no change in mortality from intentional injuries.",

The SubNiño4 index captures the evolution of subsurface ocean heat content between the El Niño and La Niña phases of the ENSO cycle, allowing it to serve as a long‐range indicator of surface ENSO and hence also many ENSO‐driven atmospheric anomalies. The SubNiño4 index has more temporally stable correlations with Niño 3.4 than the widely used western equatorial Pacific warm‐water volume indicator. For a lead time of the order of 12 months, Niño 3.4 correlations afforded by the lead observed SubNiño4 index become similar to and can exceed those produced by typical dynamical ENSO predictions. The value and viability of the SubNiño4 index as a simple statistical long‐range indicator of ENSO‐driven atmospheric response is shown for regional precipitation anomalies throughout the Tropics and fires in Continental and Maritime Southeast Asia.",

Low OLR regions are positioned within the cyclone circulation and high OLR regions are found 500-1500km to the north west of the TC. The position of the high OLR region rotates anticlockwise about the TC center as the TC motion vector rotates clockwise from westward to eastward. There is a strong association between the low level wind divergence fields and the high OLR remote region. We propose this remote high OLR region is of interest regarding TC track forecasts.

Here we document a recent trend of high thick clouds of TCs. The global inner-core high thick cloud fraction measured by satellite has decreased from 2002 to 2021 by about 10% per decade. The TC inner-core surface rain rate is also found to have decreased during the same period by a similar percentage. This suppression of high thick clouds and rain has been largest during the intensification phase of the strongest TCs. Hence, these two independent and consistent observations suggest that the TC inner-core convection has weakened and that TCs have become shallower recently at least. For this period the lifetime maximum intensity of major TCs has not changed and this suggests an increased efficiency of the spin-up of TCs.",

Here, we propose the use of empirical orthogonal functions as an approach to understand model bias of TCG. Two leading modes of large-scale wind circulations in the West Pacific can explain the TCG frequency and location in both climate reanalysis and the MetUM model. In the reanalysis, the two modes distinguish the summer monsoon trough position and the strength of the north Pacific subtropical high. However, in the model, the wind circulations are biased towards the positive phase of simulated modes thus overestimating TCG in the entire Main Development Region. This bias is further related to the north-eastward shifted monsoon trough and a weakened subtropical high, and overly strong tropics-subtropics connections. This approach could be deployed more widely to other basins and models to diagnose the causes of TCG bias.",

Most of these studies are based on data collected from relatively strong cyclones over the Atlantic. Here we explore the tropical cyclone boundary layer wind profile of mainly relatively weak landfalling cyclones near Hong Kong. We find that decaying tropical storms have a much larger mid‐ to low‐level inflow angle than those that are intensifying or in steady‐state. The inflow angles of intensifying, steady‐state and decaying tropical storms converge towards the top of the boundary layer. The wind speed reduces through the boundary layer in a similar way in all three cases. The combination of these factors means that decaying tropical storms have stronger inflow than intensifying and steady‐state ones. We attribute these local effects to remote enhanced surface friction over land when the storms are weakening.",

                "abstract": "Tropical cyclone (TC) genesis prediction is a major scientific challenge to the TC operation and research community. This report surveys the current status of TC genesis forecasts by a number of major operational centers covering the key ocean basins across both hemispheres. Since IWTC-9, we see an emergence of probabilistic TC genesis forecast products by operational centers, typically supported by the statistical processing of a combination of ensemble prediction and satellite analysis, covering time periods of couple of days to weeks ahead. The prevalence of multi-center grand ensemble approach highlights the uncertainties involved and the forecast challenges in quantitative genesis prediction. While operational practice might differ across agencies, verification efforts generally report a steady or slightly improving skill level in terms of reliability, which likely results from the continual improvement in global numerical weather prediction capability.",

                "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Knowledge of excess deaths after tropical cyclones is critical to understanding their impacts, directly relevant to policies on resilience and recovery. METHOD: We applied an ensemble of 16 Bayesian models to 40.7 million US deaths and a comprehensive record of 179 tropical cyclones over 32 years (1988 – 2019) to estimate all-cause excess deaths. The deadliest tropical cyclone was Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with 1491 [95%CrI:563,3206] excess deaths (99% posterior probability of excess deaths), including 719 [95%CrI:685,752] in Orleans Parish, LA. There were 3112 [95%CrI:2451,3699]) total post-hurricane-force excess deaths and a further 15590 [95%CrI:12084,18835]) post-gale-to-violent-storm-force deaths. 6.2% were in least socially-vulnerable counties. RESULTS: The deadliest tropical cyclone was Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with 1491 [95%CrI:563,3206] excess deaths (99% posterior probability of excess deaths), including 719 [95%CrI:685,752] in Orleans Parish, LA.

CONCLUSIONS: US post-tropical cyclone deaths were greatest after weaker winds, more recently, and in most socially vulnerable counties.",

                "abstract": "A rainfall erosivity scheme is implemented into the widely used regional atmosphere–land model, WRF. Rainfall erosivity is parametrized from hourly precipitation and surface runoff in a high resolution (4 km) convection‐permitting model. The scheme is used to examine the potential effects of changes in atmospheric aerosol concentrations on soil erosion in a case‐study of northern India and the surrounding countries for the 2010 monsoon season, using a model which isolates the indirect effect on cloud microphysics only. This study offers a preliminary investigation into this emerging topic, but longer simulations would be needed to establish a robust signal. Summer precipitation is reduced in most areas and the monsoon circulation weakens for increases in cloud condensation nuclei concentrations. This can be attributed to localised cloud microphysical changes in the northeast of India, which induce a dynamic response opposing the monsoon circulation. The two regions of greatest decrease in erosion with increasing aerosol are in the Western Ghats and the Ganges Delta, both significant cropland areas. However, the effect is not uniform, with isolated local increases in soil erosion. These results suggest that, while efforts to reduce anthropogenic aerosol emissions may improve water availability for crops through enhanced rainfall, these benefits are likely to be tempered by an increase in soil erosion, though robust local changes were difficult to predict.",

More intense and larger TCs, with higher waves, form when ocean temperature is increased. The maximum significant wave height increases more than the maximum wind speed for TCs up to hurricane force wind. However, above hurricane force wind the change in maximum wind speed is similar or greater than the change in maximum significant wave height. This can be explained by the wind drag coefficient decreasing as wind speed exceeds hurricane force wind, so that the growth of waves is dampened. The areal footprint of wave height grows considerably more than the maximum as ocean temperature is increased. This suggests a large increase in the surface area of damaging waves generated by TCs may be the dominant impact of a future warmer ocean.",

Using the Caucasus as a case study we examine the hypothesis that air temperature change can be a proxy for extreme rainfall change. Climate simulations have been performed over a two decade-long period to emulate a recent past and future climate scenario. Mean and extreme precipitation changes are shown to be decoupled. Clausius-Clapeyron scaling is considered to be a good estimator for changes in modelled extreme precipitation with temperature. The similarity between the theoretical and modelled climate results is closer for more extreme rainfall and is also found to depend on the region over which the comparison is made.",

There are limited data on how such anomalies affect deaths from injuries. In the present study, we used data on mortality and temperature over 38 years (1980-2017) in the contiguous USA and formulated a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to quantify how anomalous temperatures, defined as deviations of monthly temperature from the local average monthly temperature over the entire analysis period, affect deaths from unintentional (transport, falls and drownings) and intentional (assault and suicide) injuries, by age group and sex. We found that a 1.5 °C anomalously warm year, as envisioned under the Paris Climate Agreement, would be associated with an estimated 1,601 (95% credible interval 1,430-1,776) additional injury deaths. Of these additional deaths, 84% would occur in males, mostly in adolescence to middle age. These would comprise increases in deaths from drownings, transport, assault and suicide, offset partly by a decline in deaths from falls in older ages. The findings demonstrate the need for targeted interventions against injuries during periods of anomalously warm temperatures, especially as these episodes are likely to increase with global climate change.",

Effective adaptation for coastal regions requires reliable forecasts of risks for the season. Natural Hazard models such as the Synthetic Tropical cyclOne genRation Model (STORM) developed by Bloemendaal et al. (2020) are a common choice to assess risks without the expense of running a full forecast model. STORM has so far only been compared to observations on a basin-wide scale. However, for useful risk assessments in coastal regions, the model is also required to be skilful on much smaller spatial scales. We examine landfall statistics in some key areas such as the Gulf of Mexico. &amp;amp;#160;Numerous indices for TC genesis have been developed over the past decades that aim to derive genesis locations from meteorological variables. None of the currently operational indices however is capable of realistically modelling interannual variability in genesis numbers and locations. Here, we compare the purely statistical Poisson interannual variability to that observed. Using Poisson regression between observations and driving environmental variables such as relative sea surface temperatures and wind shear, we then produce a new index for genesis location that has better predictive skill on interannual time scales.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

                "abstract": "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We investigated a teleconnection between North Atlantic tropical storms and Amazon fires as a possible case of compound remote extreme events. South America, together with Equatorial Asia, are the two major regions contributing to the global net fire carbon emission. High-frequency fires have also been shown to impact the unique ecological structure and biodiversity in the Amazon. The drivers of fires in the Amazon region have gained much interest. It is well known that Amazonian fires are ignited by humans and are thus not purely meteorological events. In this study however, the meteorological conditions that enable fires and are thus a cause of interannual variability are the principal concern.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Chen et al. (2015) identified a relationship between June to November Amazon fires, and earlier (March to June) North Atlantic SST anomalies and the number of annual North Atlantic tropical cyclones. Intriguingly, they showed that the correlation between fires and tropical storms is actually greater than that between SST and either fires or tropical storms. They concluded that the correlation between fires and tropical storms cannot be fully explained by assuming only a common linkage of the two with the SST. However, they did not identify other possible causes or explanations for this. Here we hypothesise that tropical cyclones rainfall could play an active role in promoting Amazon fire conditions and the role of SST is actually minor. We identify this link as through anomalous precipitation in the ITCZ and in particular, for the first time, the important role of Caribbean storms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We found that the seasonal cycles of North Atlantic tropical storms and South Amazon fires are in phase with a maximum around September and have significant interannual correlation driven exclusively by Caribbean tropical storms. Years of high fire activity are associated with atmospheric conditions over the Caribbean which favour tropical cyclones, enhanced precipitation, local ascent and remote anomalous Amazon subsidence. We hypothesise a direct physical link of tropical storms in the Caribbean to fires in the South Amazon through a thermal direct circulation, Hadley-type response driven by off-equatorial heating partly caused by the storms. Anomalous precipitation over the Caribbean regardless of cause releases latent heat there and contributes to the thermal direct circulation. However, Caribbean tropical storms play an important role based on our analysis as they account for much of the precipitation anomalies there. The anomalous Amazon subsidence we observed promotes favourable fire conditions there. By focusing on the active fire season, our study leads to a deeper understanding of Amazon fire variability than previous studies which considered the pre-season. Our study helps build a more complete understanding of the drivers of Amazon fires and provides evidence of a case of remote physically linked compound extreme events.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Figure: Thermal direct cell between the Caribbean (green box) and the Amazon (red box).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://contentmanager.copernicus.org/fileStorageProxy.php?f=gnp.3b564075b0e164646112461/sdaolpUECMynit/22UGE&amp;amp;app=m&amp;amp;a=0&amp;amp;c=96b10b7fbd8427fb251b94cd639771b1&amp;amp;ct=x&amp;amp;pn=gnp.elif&amp;amp;d=1&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

                "abstract": "Rapid intensification (RI) of tropical cyclones (TCs) provides a great challenge in operational forecasting and contributes significantly to the development of major TCs. RI is commonly defined as an increase in the maximum sustained surface wind speed beyond a certain threshold within 24 h. The most widely used threshold is 30 kt (15.4 m/s), which was determined statistically. Here we propose a new definition for RI by objectively clustering TCs using the intensification rate, initial intensity, and radius of the maximum wind speed. A group of 770 samples is separated at a threshold of 45 kt (23.2 m/s). The threshold is 40 kt (20.6 m/s) for the western North Atlantic, where TC size measurements are more reliable. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed threshold is robust even considering the uncertainty in RMW of as high as 30 km. We show that, when a TC undergoes RI, its maximum wind speed is approximately 60+/-15 kt (30.9+/-7.7 m/s) and the radius of the maximum wind speed is 45+/-20 km. The new threshold outperforms the conventional threshold of 30 kt/24h in (1) describing the bimodal distribution of lifetime maximum intensity, and (2) explaining the annual count of Category 5 TCs. This new definition provides a more physically-based threshold and describes a more reliable representation to the extreme events. Although more comparisons are needed for operational application, it is likely to be desirable for process-based case studies, and could provide a more valuable metric for TC intensification classification and research.",

While enormous efforts have been devoted to studying the basin-wide fluctuation, temporal-spatial variations of global RI events remain uncertain. Here, we show that, compared with open oceans where the annual RI counts do not show any significant change, the coastal offshore regions within 400 km from the coastline host significantly more RI events, with the RI count tripled from 1980 to 2020. Reasons responsible for the coastal RI occurrence are analysed, with the dominant large-scale environmental factors identified. This work yields an important new finding that an increasing threat of RI in coastal regions has occurred in the preceding decades, which may continue in a future warming climate.",

                "abstract": "On 16 December 2020 we virtually celebrated 100 years of meteorology at Imperial. Curiously the world was in its fourth wave of the Spanish Flu when Sir Napier Shaw was appointed as the first Professor of Meteorology in 1920. Later Imperial College created the first Meteorology Department in the UK. Prof. Joanna Haigh, CBE, FRS (Imperial) started proceedings by taking us back to the origin of scientific enquiry in South Kensington, which really can be dated back to the Great Exhibition of 1851 and included the creation of the Met Office HQ on Exhibition Road (Figure 1). She then went through a roll call of some of the giants in the field including Sir Napier Shaw (contributing the tephigram), Sir Gilbert Walker (monsoon and tropical circulations), Sir David Brunt (atmospheric stability), Frank Ludlam (clouds), Eric Eady (dynamics), Sir John Mason (cloud physics) and Richard Scorer (dynamics). She unearthed some fascinating documents showing the cost of establishing the department (modest!) and the first curriculum, which also included an atmospheric electricity course by Charles Wilson (of cloud chamber fame). Prof. Sir Brian Hoskins, CBE FRS (Imperial/Reading) explored in more detail the development of the mathematical dynamical theories of Eady, which were then further developed by Bob Pearce and John Green. This stream of highly original work contributed to understanding of the general circulation and the role of eddies. In the next stage of evolution, the department merged into Physics and Prof. John Marshall, FRS (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) picked up the thread. He gave a personal account of his inspiration by Green to take up the field and the influence of the atmospheric convection work by Martin Miller and Mitchell Moncrieff to influence the creation of his ocean model. Dr Edward Gryspeerdt (Imperial) focused on the cloud work and the seminal work by Mason and Ludlam to further understand cloud formation, the growth of cloud droplets and electrification. He also showed the ‘genealogy’ of past supervisors and their students as they moved on throughout the world. Finally, Dr Helen Brindley (Imperial/Reading) brought us to the present work on satellite Earth observation and the study of the radiation budget, which can be traced back to Richard Scorer, who examined cloud images. The satellite instrumental work was established by John Harries and continues today. The distinguished alumni that joined the virtual meeting and contributed during the chat are a reminder that it was an impossible task to capture the work and impact of all. I do encourage readers to read the essay by Ken Bignell on the history of the department from 1920–1975 11 https://www.imperial.ac.uk/space-and-atmospheric-physics/history/32 and catch up on the excellent recording of the meeting online. 22 https://bit.ly/34lYtfO3334 For me, the meeting was a humbling experience.",

                "abstract": "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Smoothing of wind generation variability is important for grid integration of large-scale wind power plants. One approach to achieving smoothing is aggregating wind generation from plants that have uncorrelated or negatively correlated wind speed. It is well known that the wind speed correlation on average decays with increasing distance between plants, but the correlations may not be explained by distance alone. In India, the wind speed diurnal cycle plays a significant role in explaining the hourly correlation of wind speed between location pairs. This creates an opportunity of &amp;amp;#8220;diurnal smoothing&amp;amp;#8221;. At a given separation distance the hourly wind speeds correlation is reduced for those pairs that have a difference of +/- 12 hours in local time of wind maximum. This effect is more prominent for location pairs separated by 200 km or more and where the amplitude of the diurnal cycle is more than about&amp;amp;#160; 0.5 m/s. &amp;amp;#8220;Diurnal smoothing&amp;amp;#8221; also has a positive impact on the aggregate wind predictability and forecast error. &amp;amp;#8220;Diurnal smoothing&amp;amp;#8221; could also be important for other regions with diurnal wind speed cycles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

We assimilated combinations of (or individually) a hypothetical coastal current HF radar network, a dense array of drifter floats and minimum sea-level pressure. During the assimilation, instant updates of many important atmospheric variables (winds and pressure) are achieved from the assimilation of ocean current observations using the cross-domain error covariance, significantly improving the track and intensity analysis of Typhoon Hato. As compared to a control experiment (with no assimilation), the error of minimum pressure decreased by up to 13 hPa (4 hPa / 57 % on average). The maximum wind speed error decreased by up to 18 knots (5 knots / 41 % on average).&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By contrast, weakly coupled implementations cannot match these reductions (10% on average).

The seasonal cycles of the storms and fires are in phase with a maximum around September and have significant inter-annual correlation. Years of high Amazon fire activity are associated with atmospheric conditions over the Atlantic which favour tropical cyclones. We propose that anomalous precipitation and latent heating in the Caribbean, partly caused by tropical storms, leads to a thermal circulation response which creates anomalous subsidence and enhances surface solar heating over the Amazon. The Caribbean storms and precipitation anomalies could thus promote favourable atmospheric conditions for Amazon fire.",

                "abstract": "ABSTRACT The bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae causes disease in a wide range of plants. The associated decrease in crop yields results in economic losses and threatens global food security. Competition exists between the plant immune system and the pathogen, the basic principles of which can be applied to animal infection pathways. P. syringae uses a type III secretion system (T3SS) to deliver virulence factors into the plant that promote survival of the bacterium. The P. syringae T3SS is a product of the hypersensitive response and pathogenicity ( hrp ) and hypersensitive response and conserved ( hrc ) gene cluster, which is strictly controlled by the codependent enhancer-binding proteins HrpR and HrpS. Through a combination of bacterial gene regulation and phenotypic studies, plant infection assays, and plant hormone quantifications, we now report that Chp8 (i) is embedded in the Hrp regulon and expressed in response to plant signals and HrpRS, (ii) is a functional diguanylate cyclase, (iii) decreases the expression of the major pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) flagellin and increases extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), and (iv) impacts the salicylic acid/jasmonic acid hormonal immune response and disease progression. We propose that Chp8 expression dampens PAMP-triggered immunity during early plant infection. IMPORTANCE The global demand for food is projected to rise by 50% by 2030 and, as such, represents one of the major challenges of the 21st century, requiring improved crop management. Diseases caused by plant pathogens decrease crop yields, result in significant economic losses, and threaten global food security. Gaining mechanistic insights into the events at the plant-pathogen interface and employing this knowledge to make crops more resilient is one important strategy for improving crop management. Plant-pathogen interactions are characterized by the sophisticated interplay between plant immunity elicited upon pathogen recognition and immune evasion by the pathogen. Here, we identify Chp8 as a contributor to the major effort of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 to evade immune responses of the plant.",

In response to the plant environment DC3000 expresses hypersensitive response and pathogenicity genes (hrp). Pathogenesis depends on the ability of the pathogen to manipulate the plant metabolism and to inhibit plant immunity, which depends to a large degree on the plant's capacity to recognize both pathogen and microbial determinants (PAMP/MAMP-triggered immunity). We have developed and employed MS-based shotgun and targeted proteomics to (i) elucidate the extracellular and secretome composition of DC3000 and (ii) evaluate temporal features of the assembly of the T3SS and the secretion process together with its dependence of pH. The proteomic screen, under hrp inducing in vitro conditions, of extracellular and cytoplasmatic fractions indicated the segregated presence of not only T3SS implicated proteins such as HopP1, HrpK1, HrpA1 and AvrPto1, but also of proteins not usually associated with the T3SS or with pathogenicity. Using multiple reaction monitoring MS (MRM-MS) to quantify HrpA1 and AvrPto1, we found that HrpA1 is rapidly expressed, at a strict pH-dependent rate and is post-translationally processed extracellularly. These features appear to not interfere with rapid AvrPto1 expression and secretion but may suggest some temporal post-translational regulatory mechanism of the T3SS assembly. The high specificity and sensitivity of the MRM-MS approach should provide a powerful tool to measure secretion and translocation in infected tissues.",

                "abstract": "The type III secretion system (T3SS) is a principal virulence determinant of the model bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae T3SS effector proteins inhibit plant defense signaling pathways in susceptible hosts and elicit evolved immunity in resistant plants. The extracytoplasmic function sigma factor HrpL coordinates the expression of most T3SS genes. Transcription of hrpL is dependent on sigma-54 and the codependent enhancer binding proteins HrpR and HrpS for hrpL promoter activation. hrpL is oriented adjacently to and divergently from the HrpL-dependent gene hrpJ, sharing an intergenic upstream regulatory region. We show that association of the RNA polymerase (RNAP)-HrpL complex with the hrpJ promoter element imposes negative autogenous control on hrpL transcription in P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000. The hrpL promoter was upregulated in a ΔhrpL mutant and was repressed by plasmid-borne hrpL In a minimal Escherichia coli background, the activity of HrpL was sufficient to achieve repression of reconstituted hrpL transcription. This repression was relieved if both the HrpL DNA-binding function and the hrp-box sequence of the hrpJ promoter were compromised, implying dependence upon the hrpJ promoter. DNA-bound RNAP-HrpL entirely occluded the HrpRS and partially occluded the integration host factor (IHF) recognition elements of the hrpL promoter in vitro, implicating inhibition of DNA binding by these factors as a cause of negative autogenous control. A modest increase in the HrpL concentration caused hypersecretion of the HrpA1 pilus protein but intracellular accumulation of later T3SS substrates. We argue that negative feedback on HrpL activity fine-tunes expression of the T3SS regulon to minimize the elicitation of plant defenses.The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has warned that agriculture will need to satisfy a 50% to 70% increase in global food demand if the human population reaches 9 billion by 2050 as predicted. However, diseases caused by microbial pathogens represent a major threat to food security, accounting for over 10% of estimated yield losses in staple wheat, rice, and maize crops. Understanding the decision-making strategies employed by pathogens to coordinate virulence and to evade plant defenses is vital for informing crop resistance traits and management strategies. Many plant-pathogenic bacteria utilize the needle-like T3SS to inject virulence factors into host plant cells to suppress defense signaling. Pseudomonas syringae is an economically and environmentally devastating plant pathogen. We propose that the master regulator of its entire T3SS gene set, HrpL, downregulates its own expression to minimize elicitation of plant defenses. Revealing such conserved regulatory strategies will inform future antivirulence strategies targeting plant pathogens.",

                "abstract": "Free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria can improve growth yields of some non-leguminous plants and, if enhanced through bioengineering approaches, have the potential to address major nutrient imbalances in global crop production by supplementing inorganic nitrogen fertilisers. However, nitrogen fixation is a highly resource-costly adaptation and is de-repressed only in environments in which sources of reduced nitrogen are scarce. Here we investigate nitrogen fixation ( nif ) gene expression and nitrogen starvation response signaling in the model diazotroph Klebsiella oxytoca ( Ko ) M5a1 during ammonium depletion and the transition to growth on atmospheric N 2 . Exploratory RNA-sequencing revealed that over 50% of genes were differentially expressed under diazotrophic conditions, among which the nif genes are among the most highly expressed and highly upregulated. Isotopically labelled QconCAT standards were designed for multiplexed, absolute quantification of Nif and nitrogen-stress proteins via multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS). Time-resolved Nif protein concentrations were indicative of bifurcation in the accumulation rates of nitrogenase subunits (NifHDK) and accessory proteins. We estimate that the nitrogenase may account for more than 40% of cell protein during diazotrophic growth and occupy approximately half the active ribosome complement. The concentrations of free amino acids in nitrogen-starved cells were insufficient to support the observed rates of Nif protein expression. Total Nif protein accumulation was reduced 10-fold when the NifK protein was truncated and nitrogenase catalysis lost ( nifK 1 – 1 203 ), implying that reinvestment of de novo fixed nitrogen is essential for further nif expression and a complete diazotrophy transition. Several amino acids accumulated in non-fixing Δ nifLA and nifK 1 – 1203 mutants, while the rest remained highly stable despite prolonged N starvation. Monitoring post-translational uridylylation of the PII-type signaling proteins GlnB and GlnK revealed distinct nitrogen regulatory roles in Ko M5a1. GlnK uridylylation was persistent throughout the diazotrophy transition while a Δ glnK mutant exhibited significantly reduced Nif expression and nitrogen fixation activity. Altogether, these findings highlight quantitatively the scale of resource allocation required to enable the nitrogen fixation adaptation to take place once underlying signaling processes are fulfilled. Our work also provides an omics-level framework with which to model nitrogen fixation in free-living diazotrophs and inform rational engineering strategies.",

The expression of T3SS proteins is controlled by the HrpL σ factor. Transcription of hrpL is σ 54 -dependent and bacterial enhancer-binding proteins HrpR and HrpS coactivate the hrpL promoter. The HrpV protein imposes negative control upon HrpR and HrpS through direct interaction with HrpS. HrpG interacts with HrpV and relieves such negative control. The sequence alignments across Hrp group I-type plant pathogens revealed conserved HrpV and HrpG amino acids. To establish structure–function relationships in HrpV and HrpG, either truncated or alanine substitution mutants were constructed. Key functional residues in HrpV and HrpG are found within their C-terminal regions. In HrpG, L101 and L105 are indispensable for the ability of HrpG to directly interact with HrpV and suppress HrpV-dependent negative regulation of HrpR and HrpS. In HrpV, L108 and G110 are major determinants for interactions with HrpS and HrpG. We propose that mutually exclusive binding of HrpS and HrpG to the same binding site of HrpV governs a transition from negative control to activation of the HrpRS complex leading to HrpL expression and pathogenicity of P. syringae.",

Significant expenditures are typically required to conduct routine maintenance and repairs of affected RC bridges. Compared to conventional steel reinforcement (i.e. black rebar), corrosion resistant reinforcement is initially more expensive but provides longer service life. In this paper, corrosion-induced cracking time, traffic delays associated with bridge deck maintenance, and the environmental impact associated with these activities are integrated into a probabilistic framework to investigate the life-cycle cost of RC bridge decks with conventional and corrosion resistant reinforcement. Monte Carlo simulation is implemented to quantify the probabilistic life-cycle cost of the bridge deck. Preliminary results obtained from this project show that corrosion resistant reinforcement has lower life-cycle cost compared to conventional reinforcement. The indirect cost associated with traffic delays accounts for over 50% of the total life-cycle cost for the investigated case study.",

In diazotrophic Klebsiella oxytoca we simultaneously measured mRNA levels of key regulatory ( glnK-amtB, nifLA ) and structural ( nifHDK ) operons required for establishing nitrogen fixation, using dual molecule, single cell RNA-FISH. Through stochastic transcription models and mutual information analysis we revealed likely molecular origins for heterogeneity in nitrogenase expression. In wildtype and regulatory variant strains we inferred contributions from intrinsic and extrinsic noise, finding that nifHDK transcription is inherently bursty, but that noise propagation through signalling is also significant. The regulatory gene glnK had the highest discernible effect on nifHDK variance, while noise from factors outside of the regulatory pathway were negligible. Results provide evidence that heterogeneity is a fundamental property of this regulatory system, indicating potential constraints for engineering homogeneous nitrogenase expression.",

                "abstract": "Phenotypic heterogeneity in clonal bacterial batch cultures has been shown for a range of bacterial systems; however, the molecular origins of such heterogeneity and its magnitude are not well understood. Under conditions of extreme low-nitrogen stress in the model diazotroph Klebsiella oxytoca, we found remarkably high heterogeneity of nifHDK gene expression, which codes for the structural genes of nitrogenase, one key enzyme of the global nitrogen cycle. This heterogeneity limited the bulk observed nitrogen-fixing capacity of the population. Using dual-probe, single-cell RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization, we correlated nifHDK expression with that of nifLA and glnK-amtB, which code for the main upstream regulatory components. Through stochastic transcription models and mutual information analysis, we revealed likely molecular origins for heterogeneity in nitrogenase expression. In the wild type and regulatory variants, we found that nifHDK transcription was inherently bursty, but we established that noise propagation through signaling was also significant. The regulatory gene glnK had the highest discernible effect on nifHDK variance, while noise from factors outside the regulatory pathway were negligible. Understanding the basis of inherent heterogeneity of nitrogenase expression and its origins can inform biotechnology strategies seeking to enhance biological nitrogen fixation. Finally, we speculate on potential benefits of diazotrophic heterogeneity in natural soil environments. IMPORTANCE Nitrogen is an essential micronutrient for both plant and animal life and naturally exists in both reactive and inert chemical forms. Modern agriculture is heavily reliant on nitrogen that has been \"fixed\" into a reactive form via the energetically expensive Haber-Bosch process, with significant environmental consequences. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria provide an alternative source of fixed nitrogen for use in both biotechnological and agricultural settings, but this relies on a firm understanding of how the fixation process is regulated within individual bacterial cells. We examined the cell-to-cell variability in the nitrogen-fixing behavior of Klebsiella oxytoca, a free-living bacterium. The significance of our research is in identifying not only the presence of marked variability but also the specific mechanisms that give rise to it. This understanding gives insight into both the evolutionary advantages of variable behavior as well as strategies for biotechnological applications.",

Here we examine the RuO2 OER kinetics on rutile (110), (100), (101), and (111) orientations, finding (100) the most active. We assess the potential involvement of lattice oxygen in the OER mechanism with online electrochemical mass spectrometry, which showed no evidence of oxygen exchange on these oriented facets in acidic or basic electrolytes. Similar results were obtained for polyoriented RuO2 films and particles, in contrast to previous work, suggesting lattice oxygen is not exchanged in catalyzing OER on crystalline RuO2 surfaces. This hypothesis is supported by the correlation of activity with the number of active Ru-sites calculated by density functional theory, where more active facets bind oxygen more weakly. This new understanding of the active sites provides a design strategy to enhance the OER activity of RuO2 nanoparticles by facet engineering.",

                "abstract": "The CO_{2} electro-reduction reaction (CORR) is a promising avenue to convert greenhouse gases into high-value fuels and chemicals, in addition to being an attractive method for storing intermittent renewable energy. Although polycrystalline Cu surfaces have long known to be unique in their capabilities of catalyzing the conversion of CO_{2} to higher-order C1 and C2 fuels, such as hydrocarbons (CH_{4}, C_{2}H_{4} etc.) and alcohols (CH_{3}OH, C_{2}H_{5}OH), product selectivity remains a challenge. In this study, we select three metal catalysts (Pt, Au, Cu) and apply in situ surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS), coupled to density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, to get insight into the reaction pathway for the CORR. We present a comprehensive reaction mechanism for the CORR, and show that the preferential reaction pathway can be rationalized in terms of metal-carbon (M-C) and metal-oxygen (M-O) affinity. We show that the final products are determined by the configuration of the initial intermediates, C-bound and O-bound, which can be obtained from CO_{2} and (H)CO_{3}, respectively. C1 hydrocarbons are produced via OCH_{3, ad} intermediates obtained from O-bound CO_{3, ad} and require a catalyst with relatively high affinity for O-bound intermediates. Additionally, C2 hydrocarbon formation is suggested to result from the C-C coupling between C-bound CO_{ad} and (H)CO_{ad}, which requires an optimal affinity for the C-bound species, so that (H)CO_{ad} can be further reduced without poisoning the catalyst surface. Our findings pave the way towards a design strategy for CORR catalysts with improved selectivity, based on this experimental/theoretical reaction mechanisms that have been identified.",

In this work, a series of structure-making/breaking cations in the electrolyte were investigated as spectator cations in hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) in the pH range of 1 to 14, whose kinetics was found to be altered by up to 2 orders of magnitude by these cations. The exchange current density of HER/HOR was shown to increase with greater structure-making tendency of cations in the order of Cs+ < Rb+ < K+ < Na+ < Li+, which was accompanied by decreasing reorganization energy from the Marcus-Hush-Chidsey formalism and increasing reaction entropy. Invoking the Born model of reorganization energy and reaction entropy, the static dielectric constant of the electrolyte at the electrified interface was found to be significantly lower than that of bulk, decreasing with the structure-making tendency of cations at the negatively charged Pt surface. The physical origin of cation-dependent HER/HOR kinetics can be rationalized by an increase in concentration of cations on the negatively charged Pt surface, altering the interfacial water structure and the H-bonding network, which is supported by classical molecular dynamics simulation and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy. This work highlights immense opportunities to control the reaction rates by tuning interfacial structures of cation and solvents.",

Here, we investigate a series of Mn-, Co-, Fe-, and Zn-doped nickel oxides using operando UV-vis spectroscopy coupled with time-resolved stepped potential spectroelectrochemistry. The Ni2+/Ni3+ redox peak potential is found to shift anodically from Mn- < Co- < Fe- < Zn-doped samples, suggesting a decrease in oxygen binding energetics from Mn- to Zn-doped samples. At OER-relevant potentials, using optical absorption spectroscopy, we quantitatively detect the subsequent oxidation of these redox centers. The OER kinetics was found to have a second-order dependence on the density of these oxidized species, suggesting a chemical rate-determining step involving coupling of two oxo species. The intrinsic turnover frequency per oxidized species exhibits a volcano trend with the binding energy of oxygen on the Ni site, having a maximum activity of ∼0.05 s-1 at 300 mV overpotential for the Fe-doped sample. Consequently, we propose that for Ni centers that bind oxygen too strongly (Mn- and Co-doped oxides), OER kinetics is limited by O-O coupling and oxygen desorption, while for Ni centers that bind oxygen too weakly (Zn-doped oxides), OER kinetics is limited by the formation of oxo groups. This study not only experimentally demonstrates the relation between electroadsorption free energy and intrinsic kinetics for OER on this class of materials but also highlights the critical role of oxidized species in facilitating OER kinetics.",

Here we quantify the densities of redox-active centres and probe their binding strengths on amorphous IrO x and rutile IrO 2 using operando time-resolved optical spectroscopy. We establish a quantitative experimental correlation between the intrinsic reaction rate and the active-state energetics. We find that adsorbed oxygen species, *O, formed at water oxidation potentials, exhibit repulsive adsorbate–adsorbate interactions. Increasing their coverage weakens their binding, thereby promoting O–O bond formation, which is the rate-determining step. These analyses suggest that although amorphous IrO x exhibits a higher geometric current density, the intrinsic reaction rates per active state on IrO x and IrO 2 are comparable at given potentials. Finally, we present a modified volcano plot that elucidates how the intrinsic water oxidation kinetics can be increased by optimizing both the binding energy and the interaction strength between the catalytically active states.",

Here, we combine operando optical spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) to probe the effect of noncovalent interactions on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of IrOx in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Our results suggest that the active species for the OER (Ir4.x+–*O) binds much stronger in alkaline compared with acid at low coverage, while the repulsive interactions between these species are higher in alkaline electrolytes. These differences are attributed to the larger fraction of water within the cation hydration shell at the interface in alkaline electrolytes compared to acidic electrolytes, which can stabilize oxygenated intermediates and facilitate long-range interactions between them. Quantitative analysis of the state energetics shows that although the *O intermediates bind more strongly than optimal in alkaline electrolytes, the larger repulsive interaction between them results in a significant weakening of *O binding with increasing coverage, leading to similar energetics of active states in acid and alkaline at OER-relevant potentials. By directly probing the electrochemical interface with complementary spectroscopic techniques, our work goes beyond conventional computational descriptors of the OER activity to explain the experimentally observed OER kinetics of IrOx in acidic and alkaline electrolytes.",

Here, we showed that on RuO2(110) in alkaline solutions, OER activity is cation-dependent, being largest in 0.1 M KOH compared to LiOH and NaOH. Using crystal truncation rod analysis, −O is detected on the coordinatively unsaturated site at 1.5 VRHE in 0.1 M KOH, suggesting that the rate-determining step is −O + OH– → -OOH + e–, which is different from that in acid involving the final deprotonation of −OOH. The ordering of interfacial water in base was found to decrease with increasing potential and independent of cations. Using surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy, the density of isolated water molecules (zero H-bonds) was found to increase, and the density of icelike water molecules (four H-bonds) decreases from Li+ to K+ at OER potentials. The higher activity of more isolated interfacial OH– ions in the case of K+ and the lesser stabilization of −O intermediates by hydration water of K+ compared to Na+ and Li+ can result in higher OER activity for KOH.

                "abstract": "Water oxidation is the step limiting the efficiency of electrocatalytic hydrogen production from water. Spectroelectrochemical analyses are employed to make a direct comparison of water oxidation reaction kinetics between a molecular catalyst, the dimeric iridium catalyst [Ir2(pyalc)2(H2O)4-(μ-O)]2+ (IrMolecular, pyalc = 2-(2'pyridinyl)-2-propanolate) immobilized on a mesoporous indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, with that of an heterogeneous electrocatalyst, an amorphous hydrous iridium (IrOx) film. For both systems, four analogous redox states were detected, with the formation of Ir(4+)-Ir(5+) being the potential-determining step in both cases. However, the two systems exhibit distinct water oxidation reaction kinetics, with potential-independent first-order kinetics for IrMolecular contrasting with potential-dependent kinetics for IrOx. This is attributed to water oxidation on the heterogeneous catalyst requiring co-operative effects between neighboring oxidized Ir centers. The ability of IrMolecular to drive water oxidation without such co-operative effects is explained by the specific coordination environment around its Ir centers. These distinctions between molecular and heterogeneous reaction kinetics are shown to explain the differences observed in their water oxidation electrocatalytic performance under different potential conditions.",

                "abstract": "Pt-based bimetallic electrocatalysts are promising candidates to convert surplus glycerol from the biodiesel industry to value-added chemicals and coproduce hydrogen. It is expected that the nature and content of the elements in the bimetallic catalyst can not only affect the reaction kinetics but also influence the product selectivity, providing a way to increase the yield of the desired products. Hence, in this work, we investigate the electrochemical oxidation of glycerol on a series of PtNi nanoparticles with increasing Ni content using a combination of physicochemical structural analysis, electrochemical measurements, operando spectroscopic techniques, and advanced product characterizations. With a moderate Ni content and a homogenously alloyed bimetallic Pt-Ni structure, the PtNi2 catalyst displayed the highest reaction activity among all materials studied in this work. In situ FTIR data show that PtNi2 can activate the glycerol molecule at a more negative potential (0.4 VRHE) than the other PtNi catalysts. In addition, its surface can effectively catalyze the complete C-C bond cleavage, resulting in lower CO poisoning and higher stability. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and UV-vis spectroscopy suggest that glycerol adsorbs strongly onto surface Ni(OH) x sites, preventing their oxidation and activation of oxygen or hydroxyl from water. As such, we propose that the role of Ni in PtNi toward glycerol oxidation is to tailor the electronic structure of the pure Pt sites rather than a bifunctional mechanism. Our experiments provide guidance for the development of bimetallic catalysts toward highly efficient, selective, and stable glycerol oxidation reactions.",

                "abstract": "A barrier to understanding the factors driving catalysis in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is understanding multiple overlapping redox transitions in the OER catalysts. The complexity of these transitions obscure the relationship between the coverage of adsorbates and OER kinetics, leading to an experimental challenge in measuring activity descriptors, such as binding energies, as well as adsorbate interactions, which may destabilize intermediates and modulate their binding energies. Herein, we utilize a newly designed optical spectroelectrochemistry system to measure these phenomena in order to contrast the behavior of two electrocatalysts, cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) and cobalt–iron hexacyanoferrate (cobalt–iron Prussian blue, CoFe-PB). Three distinct optical spectra are observed in each catalyst, corresponding to three separate redox transitions, the last of which we show to be active for the OER using time-resolved spectroscopy and electrochemical mass spectroscopy. By combining predictions from density functional theory with parameters obtained from electroadsorption isotherms, we demonstrate that a destabilization of catalytic intermediates occurs with increasing coverage. In CoOOH, a strong (∼0.34 eV/monolayer) destabilization of a strongly bound catalytic intermediate is observed, leading to a potential offset between the accumulation of the intermediate and measurable O2 evolution. We contrast these data to CoFe-PB, where catalytic intermediate generation and O2 evolution onset coincide due to weaker binding and destabilization (∼0.19 eV/monolayer). By considering a correlation between activation energy and binding strength, we suggest that such adsorbate driven destabilization may account for a significant fraction of the observed OER catalytic activity in both materials. Finally, we disentangle the effects of adsorbate interactions on state coverages and kinetics to show how adsorbate interactions determine the observed Tafel slopes. Crucially, the case of CoFe-PB shows that, even where interactions are weaker, adsorption remains non-Nernstian, which strongly influences the observed Tafel slope.",

In this work, we combine ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ surface diffraction, and density functional theory calculations to investigate how four different facets of RuO2 interact with water under humid and electrochemical environments. The vacant coordinatively unsaturated Ru site (CUS) allows for the adsorption and dissociation of water molecules. Different surfaces exhibit unique binding energetics for −H2O and −OH and can allow for different degrees of hydrogen bonding between the adsorbates. Consequently, the degree of water dissociation is found to be sensitive to the surface crystallographic orientation—being maximum for the (101) surface, followed by the (110), (001) and (100) surfaces. This study identifies crystallographic orientation as an important parameter to tune not only the density of active sites but also the energetics for water dissociation; this finding is of great significance for many catalytic reactions, where water is a key reactant, or product.",

In this study, we employ time-resolved operando spectroelectrochemistry to investigate the redox-state kinetics of IrOx electrocatalyst films for both water and hydrogen peroxide oxidation. Three different redox species involving Ir3+, Ir3.x+, Ir4+, and Ir4.y+ are identified spectroscopically, and their concentrations are quantified as a function of applied potential. The generation of Ir4.y+ states is found to be the potential-determining step for catalytic water oxidation, while H2O2 oxidation is observed to be driven by the generation of Ir4+ states. The reaction kinetics for water oxidation, determined from the optical signal decays at open circuit, accelerates from ∼20 to <0.5 s with increasing applied potential above 1.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode [i.e., turnover frequencies (TOFs) per active Ir state increasing from 0.05 to 2 s–1]. In contrast, the reaction kinetics for H2O2 is found to be almost independent of the applied potential (increasing from 0.1 to 0.3 s–1 over a wider potential window), indicative of a first-order reaction mechanism. These spectroelectrochemical data quantify the increase of both the density of active Ir4.y+ states and the TOFs of these states with applied positive potential, resulting in the observed sharp turn on of catalytic water oxidation current. We reconcile these data with the broader literature while providing a unique kinetic insight into IrOx electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms, indicating a first-order reaction mechanism for H2O2 oxidation driven by Ir4+ states and a higher-order reaction mechanism involving the cooperative interaction of multiple Ir4.y+ states for water oxidation.",

Such junctions are promising candidates for solar‐driven water splitting; however, the poor underwater stability of the small molecular acceptor in such devices has limited their viability to date. Here, a stable and efficient organic photoanode is demonstrated for water oxidation based upon a Y6:PM6 BHJ with a further dual functional PM6 layer transferred from water, and Au/NiFe electrocatalyst top layers.

These BHJ/PM6 based photoanodes exhibit a photocurrent density of 4.0 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode and promising operational stability compared to the anode without a PM6 layer, maintaining a photocurrent ≥ 2 mA cm −2 over 1 h.

                "abstract": "Nickel-based oxides and oxyhydroxide catalysts exhibit state-of-the-art activity for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. A widely employed strategy to increase the gravimetric activity of the catalyst is to increase the active surface area via nanostructuring or decrease the particle size. However, the fundamental understanding about how tuning these parameters influences the density of oxidized species and their reaction kinetics remains unclear. Here, we use solution combustion synthesis, a low-cost and scalable approach, to synthesize a series of Fe0.1Ni0.9O samples from different precursor salts. Based on the precursor salt, the nanoparticle size can be changed significantly from ∼2.5 to ∼37 nm. The OER activity at pH 13 trends inversely with the particle size. Using operando time-resolved optical spectroscopy, we quantify the density of oxidized species as a function of potential and demonstrate that the OER kinetics exhibits a second-order dependence on the density of these species, suggesting that the OER mechanism relies on O–O coupling between neighboring oxidized species. With the decreasing particle size, the density of species accumulated is found to increase, and their intrinsic reactivity for the OER is found to decrease, attributed to the stronger binding of *O species (i.e., a cathodic shift of species energetics). This signifies that the high apparent OER activity per geometric area of the smaller nanoparticles is driven by their ability to accumulate a larger density of oxidized species. This study not only experimentally disentangles the influence of the density of oxidized species and intrinsic kinetics on the overall rate of the OER but also highlights the importance of tuning these parameters independently to develop more active OER catalysts.",

The degree of hydroxyl formation on the oxide surface correlated with the proximity of the valence band center relative to the Fermi level. LSMO perovskites with a valence band center closer to the Fermi level were more reactive toward water, forming more hydroxyl species at a given relative humidity. More hydroxyl species correlate with greater electron-donating character to the surface free energy in wetting and reduce the activity to catalyze oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics in a basic solution.

We show that during potential cycling in 1 M KHCO3 electrolyte, CO adsorbates (COad), more specifically, COad surrounded by OH adsorbates (OHad), with linear or bridged configuration, were produced through the reductive adsorption of HCO3– catalyzed by H adsorbates on Pt. The COad coadsorbed with OHad was oxidized to COOHad at potentials as low as ∼0.3 VRHE, which was further oxidized to CO2 at 0.9 VRHE and higher. Further analysis suggests that the proximity between COad and OHad is key to trigger the conversion reaction from COad to CO2 through forming COOHad intermediate at room temperature. The details about how Pt surface adsorbates change as a function of voltage in CO2-saturated alkaline electrolytes can provide strategies to design CO-tolerant catalysts for fuel cell applications and active and selective catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction.",

Recently, several alternative reaction mechanisms with lower overpotentials were proposed for highly active catalysts. While for such reaction mechanisms additional intermediates leading to nonelectrochemical reaction steps could be considered, they are usually neglected when the thermodynamic overpotential of such mechanisms is investigated. We show here that this is a valid approximation for endothermic nonelectrochemical steps, which only affect the kinetics, while exothermic nonelectrochemical steps can also affect the thermodynamic overpotential. We show this on the basis of density functional theory calculations for one of those proposed mechanisms on surfaces of different perovskite oxides and oxynitrides. We find that for weakly binding surfaces the *O adsorbate spontaneously adopts a bidentate bridged dimer structure in a nonelectrochemical step with an energy gain in excess of 1 eV. This decrease in free energy needs to be compensated by an equivalent increase in magnitude of the electrochemical steps, which can affect the thermodynamic overpotential. This change may result in reaction mechanisms without nonelectrochemical steps having smaller thermodynamic overpotentials and thus being more favorable.",

We further demonstrate that the surface chemistry of the A-site cation strongly influences CO2 reactivity; the La, Sr, and Ba cations in the LaCoO3, La0.4Sr0.6CoO3, SrCoO2.5, and Pr0.5Ba0.5CoO3 thin films showed significant carbon adsorbate speciation. Additionally, we link the La0.4Sr0.6CoO3 surface chemistry to its surface reactivity toward formation of bidentate (bi)carbonate species via exchange of lattice oxygen with carbonate oxygen. In conclusion, we show that the perovskite electronic structure ultimately dictates the driving force for formation of oxidized oxo-carbonaceous species (CO3) versus reduced species (C–C/C–H). A higher O 2p-band center relative to the Fermi level was correlated with a higher degree of (bi)carbonate formation relative to the other carbonaceous species observed (C–C/C–H and −CO) due to a more facile charge transfer from oxygen states at the Fermi level to free CO2 gas.",

                "abstract": "Nickel-based oxides and oxyhydroxide catalysts exhibit state-of-the-art activity for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline conditions. A widely employed strategy to increase the gravimetric activity of the catalyst is to increase the active surface area via nanostructuring or decreasing the particle size. However, fundamental understanding about how tuning these parameters influences the density of oxidized species and their reaction kinetics remains unclear. Here, we use solution combustion synthesis, a low-cost and scalable approach, to synthesize a series of Fe0.1Ni0.9O samples from different precursor salts. Based on the precursor salt, the nanoparticle size can be changed significantly from ~2.5 nm to ~37 nm. The OER activity in pH 13 trends inversely with the particle size. Using operando, time-resolved optical spectroscopy, we quantify the density of oxidized species as a function of potential and demonstrate that the OER kinetics exhibits a second order dependence on the density of these species, suggesting that the OER mechanism relies on O-O coupling between neighbouring oxidized species. With decreasing particle size, the density of species accumulated is found to increase, with a decrease in their intrinsic reactivity for OER, attributed to a stronger binding of *O species (i.e. a cathodic shift of species energetics). This signifies that the high apparent OER activity per geometric area of the smaller nanoparticles is driven by their ability to accumulate a larger density of oxidized species. This study not only experimentally disentangles the influence of the density of oxidized species and intrinsic kinetics on the overall rate of OER, but also highlights the importance of tuning these parameters independently to develop more active OER catalysts.",

Herein, we show that a descriptor based on the oxide electronic structure of catalysts, defined as the surface O 2p-band center relative to the Fermi level, plays an important role in dictating methanol oxidation activity and selectivity toward HCHO for cobalt-based perovskites. Using a combination of ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) and density functional theory (DFT), CH3OH adsorption with the O–H bond scission on surface cobalt sites was found to be more favorable than the O–H bond scission on surface oxygen sites or oxygen vacancy sites. As the O 2p-band center moved closer to the Fermi level in cobalt-based perovskites with greater Sr substitution, the rate-limiting step for CH3OH oxidation kinetics was changed from the adsorption of CH3OH on surface cobalt sites on LaCoO3 (LCO) to O2 adsorption and desorption of H2O on SrCoO3 (SCO). Oxides with intermediate surface oxygen activity such as La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (LSC64) were shown to provide the highest activity for CH3OH oxidation to HCHO. Such a tuning of oxide surface electronic structure characteristics and speciation can be extended to design catalysts for selective oxidation of other small molecules such as acetic acid, 2-propanol, and propane.",

However, the lack of understanding of the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) mechanism in alkaline media hinders the development of active catalysts for the MOR. In this work, ambient-pressure XPS and in situ surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy were performed on the Pt surface in order to gain experimental insights into the reaction pathway for the MOR. We present a comprehensive reaction mechanism for the MOR in alkaline media and show that the MOR proceeds via two different pathways depending on the electrode potential. We confirmed the formation of partially hydrogenated CO adsorbates [HxCOad···(OH) (1 < x < 3)] via water and/or hydroxide ion-mediated dissociation of methanol. The HxCOad···(OH) species were further dehydrogenated to COad in the potential range of 0.40–0.60 VRHE and subsequently oxidized to CO2 by reactive OHad on the Pt surface at 0.65 VRHE (pathway I). Furthermore, H3C–Oad intermediates were observed at potentials higher than 0.9 VRHE, at which the MOR proceeds mainly via H3C–Oad instead of COad intermediates (pathway II). The oxidation current related to this conversion from H3C–Oad to CO2 (pathway II) dominates the overall MOR current, suggesting that the H3C–Oad pathway could be one of the keys to enhancing the MOR activity in an alkaline environment. Our findings pave the way toward a design strategy for MOR electrocatalysts with improved activity based on the experimental reaction mechanisms that have been identified.",

Upon slow delithiation in water over long time periods, micron‐sized Li 2 RuO 3 particles structurally transform from an O3 structure to an O1 structure with a corresponding loss of 1.25 Li ions per formula unit. The O1 stacking of the honeycomb Ru layers is imaged using high‐resolution high‐angle annular dark‐field scanning transmission electron microscopy, and the resulting structure is solved by X‐ray powder diffraction and electron diffraction. In situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy suggests that reversible oxidation/reduction of bulk Ru sites is realized on potential cycling between 0.4 and 1.25 V RHE in basic solutions. In addition to surface redox pseudocapacitance, the partially delithiated phase of Li 2 RuO 3 shows high capacity, which can be attributed to bulk Ru redox in the structure. This work demonstrates that the interaction of aqueous electrolytes with Li‐rich layered oxides can result in the formation of new phases with (electro)chemical properties that are distinct from the parent material. This understanding is important for the design of aqueous batteries, electrochemical capacitors, and chemically stable cathode materials for Li‐ion batteries.",

In this talk, I will present our research on probing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) relevant species on iridium-based catalysts. This involves a combination of time-resolved operando optical spectroscopy, soft and hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and electrochemical mass spectrometry. Initially, I will discuss the intermediate and catalytically active states of iridium oxides. This is based on correlating optically detected states with oxygen molecular products identified through on-chip electrochemical mass spectrometry. Subsequently, I will demonstrate how we used optical spectroscopy to quantify these states as a function of potential. The nature of these states, including the Ir oxidation state and surface adsorbates on iridium sites, will be elucidated using a combination of time-resolved Ir-L edge XAS, O-K edge XAS, and supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT).

                "abstract": "Ongoing concerns over anthropogenic emissions, fossil fuel sustainability, and related geopolitical aspects point to an increasing need for cost-effective renewable fuel sources. A promising solution is the generation of hydrogen via the catalytic splitting of water, which can be achieved with the aid of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. Notably, the anode material in current commercially available PEM electrolyzers is typically iridium oxide. Despite its effectiveness in facilitating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the use of iridium oxide poses challenges due to the scarcity and high cost associated with this precious metal. As the quest for sustainable energy intensifies, ongoing research explores innovative approaches, such as the incorporation of alternative materials and catalysts, to enhance efficiency while addressing the economic and environmental concerns associated with iridium oxide. Studies have shown that incorporating mixed oxides and switching the supports for iridium oxide catalysts help lower the iridium loading while enhancing the OER performance. 1,2 In this study, we investigate a series of different sputtered, mixed iridium oxides (Ta, Ti, Ir). We use a rotating disk electrode system to benchmark the catalytic activity of different loadings of mixed oxides. To measure the intrinsic activity of each catalytic active site, we use a home-built operando UV-Vis system to quantify the populations of surface species as well as track the kinetics of different redox transitions during OER. We incorporate nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry to probe the migration of different mixed oxide species before and after electrochemical cycling and use kelvin probe force microscopy to estimate the conductivity through the different films. In this study, we show the importance of cooperative effects between neighboring iridium oxide species and the coordination of iridium that are responsible for enhanced OER performance. These results indicate that doping modulates coverage dependent interactions at the surface, which affects both the binding energetics and populations of rate limiting intermediates. We believe this study will serve as a steppingstone for future designs of more cost-efficient PEM electrolyzers.

                "abstract": "Abstract With the increasing demand for hydrogen energy, the non-noble metal catalysts in water splitting for hydrogen production are significant for addressing global environmental issues. [1] Among them, layered transition metal oxide/hydroxide (LTMO/LTMH) materials have drawn more attention for their high tunability of surface or bulk structural transformations after introducing different cations inside the interlayer, which could manifest OER activity. [2] Therefore, birnessite-layered manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) is considered a potential material for its ability to create a container for cation intercalation, which could significantly enhance its behavior in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). [3] However, most of the investigations of its application in OER considered MnO 2 layers as active sites, which may underestimate the function of intercalated cations and hence blur its real reaction active sites. Using the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) theory recently sheds new light and provides a new road for improving OER performance; hard Lewis acid captures hydroxyl and thus speeds up the cleavage of water molecules, generating a demanding local alkaline environment. [4-6] Herein, we grounded the perspective of the intercalated cations based on the HSAB theory, using layered MnO 2 as the “container” for accommodating hard Lewis acid cations, achieving using Lewis acid cations for active sites, to enhance OER activity. We use the electrodeposition method to synthesize the precursor layered catalyst, TBA + /MnO 2 . With the ion exchange process, cations with different Lewis acidities (K + , Fe 3+ , Co 2+ , Ni 2+ , Cu 2+ , and Zn 2+ ) were intercalated inside this “nano-cell” (interlayer of layered MnO 2 ) to discuss how they influenced the confined surrounding electrolyte environment and electron/mass transport. X-ray diffraction, Raman, and inductively coupled plasma verified the successful synthesis of layered MnO 2 with different cations intercalated. The OER results of cation-intercalated MnO 2 catalysts exhibited that intercalating the harder Lewis acid significantly influences the interlayer electrolyte environment, markedly accelerating and enhancing the reaction kinetics and OER activity. Furthermore, comparing the OER behavior of intercalated cations, free cations, and bulk metal foils, the intercalated hard Lewis acid cations showed superior reaction kinetics.

                "abstract": "Iridium oxide (IrO 2 ) stands out as the most effective catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a pivotal component of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. Despite its exceptional catalytic prowess, the kinetics of this reaction still impose limitations on the efficient production of green H 2 , thereby inflating costs and impeding broader commercialization. The catalytic activity of IrO 2 for OER is influenced by its local chemical and atomic environment, wherein distinct crystallographic facets with unique atomic arrangements can induce significant variations even with the same bulk composition. In this study, we examine the OER performance across five distinct rutile IrO 2 facets. Through DFT calculations, we predict cyclic voltammetry (under the water oxidation potential) and compare directly to the results to experiments conducted on IrO 2 thin films for validation. Unlike pure metallic systems characterized by degenerate active sites resulting in broad single redox peaks, or homogeneous systems where redox reactions occur at metallic centers, active sites on metal oxide surfaces exhibit localization yet remain interconnected via various types of oxygen bonds. This unique attribute introduces additional considerations that must be included to interpret redox behavior, because interactions between adjacent intermediates alter their identities differently for different applied potentials. We find that multiple redox features can overlap while a single type of redox couple can be associated with multiple redox features. To elucidate the OER activity under operational conditions (&gt; 1.23 V RHE ), we conducted grand canonical calculations to explicitly capture the dependence of reactions on the applied potential, with particular emphasis on non-electrochemical steps such as O-O coupling. Through the construction of various possible OER pathways and amalgamating their energy landscapes into a unified microkinetic scheme under steady-state assumptions, we successfully replicate the experimental OER current density for each of the five facets. Our analysis unveils mechanistic disparities between nucleophilic attack and direct oxo coupling across facets, predicting rates as a function of applied potential and identifying the rate-limiting steps. Our approach provides a thorough comprehension of the OER mechanism at the atomic level, offering valuable insights into the structural characteristics that enhance or inhibit the OER activity of IrO 2 . We expect these insights to have implications for understanding the structural effects on other heterogeneous catalysts which should aid the development of more efficient electrocatalysts.",

Here, we combine operando optical spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy to probe the effect of non-covalent interactions on OER activity of IrOx in acidic and alkaline electrolyte. Our results suggest the active species for OER (Ir4.x+-*O) binds much stronger in alkaline compared with acid at low coverage, while the repulsive interactions between these species is higher in alkaline electrolyte. These differences are attributed to the larger fraction of water within the cation hydration shell at the interface in alkaline electrolytes compared to acidic electrolytes, which can stabilise oxygenated intermediates and facilitate long-range interactions between them. Quantitative analysis of the state energetics shows that although the *O intermediates bind more strongly than optimal in alkaline electrolyte; the larger repulsive interaction between them results in significant weakening of *O binding with increasing coverage, leading to similar energetics of active states in acid and alkaline at OER-relevant potentials. By directly probing the electrochemical interface with complementary spectroscopic techniques, our work goes beyond conventional computational descriptors of OER activity to explain the experimentally observed OER kinetics of IrOx in acidic and alkaline electrolytes.",

Here we employed a library of protic ionic liquids in an interfacial layer on Pt and Au to alter local proton activity, where the intrinsic ORR activity was enhanced up to 5 times, exhibiting a volcano-shaped dependence on the pKa of the ionic liquid. The enhanced ORR activity was attributed to favorable proton transfer kinetics for strengthened hydrogen bonds between the ionic liquid to the ORR product with comparable pKa. This proposed mechanism was supported by in situ surface-enhanced Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and our simulation of PCET kinetics based on computed proton vibrational wavefunction at the H-bond interface.

In this study, we employ time-resolved operando spectroelectrochemistry to investigate the redox states kinetics of IrOx electrocatalyst films for both water and hydrogen peroxide oxidation. Three different redox species involving Ir3+, Ir4+ and Ir4.x are identified spectroscopically and their concentrations are quantified as a function of applied potential. The generation of Ir4.x+ states is found to be the potential determining step for catalytic water oxidation, whilst H2O2 oxidation is observed to be driven by the generation of Ir4+ states. The reaction kinetics for water oxidation, determined from the optical signal decays at open circuit, accelerate from ~ 20 s to &lt; 0.5 s with increasing applied potential above 1.3V vs. RHE (i.e. TOFs per active Ir state increasing from 0.05 to 2 s-1). In contrast, the reaction kinetics for H2O2 are found to be almost independent of the applied potential (increasing from 0.1-0.3 s-1 over a wider potential window), indicative of a first order reaction mechanism. These spectroelectrochemical data quantify the increase of both the density of active Ir4.x+ states and the TOFs of these states with applied positive potential, resulting in the observed sharp turn on of catalytic water oxidation current. We reconcile these data with the broader literature while providing a new kinetic insight into IrOx electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms, indicating a first order reaction mechanism for H2O2 oxidation driven by Ir4+ states, and a higher order reaction mechanism involving the co-operative interaction of multiple Ir4.x+ states for water oxidation.",

In this work, we examine the structural and chemical changes occurring on oriented RuO 2 single crystal surfaces as a function of potential, in acidic electrolyte, using in situ synchrotron-based surface X-ray diffraction (crystal truncation rod) measurements. We find that the positions of the surface Ru and O atoms are largely unchanged from 0.5 V to 1.5 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale while adsorbed water molecules on the co-ordinatively unsaturated site (CUS) are deprotonated gradually with increasing potential. At oxygen evolution potentials, we observe the formation of an –OO like group on the co-ordinatively unsaturated site, which is the probable precursor of the evolved oxygen. In order to validate experimentally observed changes in the nature of adsorbed oxygen, we use density functional theory to compute surface Pourbaix diagrams that show the most stable surface termination at any given potential. The experimental and computational results are in strong agreement and provide an atomistic understanding of the surface structural changes associated with the redox transitions prior to oxygen evolution and its implications on the oxygen evolution pathway on RuO 2 .

We start with the thermodynamically stable (110) surface, where we show that the coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) are the active sites for oxygen evolution. We also detect the formation of an –OO like group on the CUS site, which is the probable precursor of the evolved oxygen. We thus propose a four proton-electron mechanism for OER, where the final proton-electron removal is found to be rate limiting 6 . Using this evidence, we can rationally tune the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of RuO 2 surfaces by modifying the surface structure to increase the density of coordinatively unsaturated sites and optimize the binding strength of oxygenated species on the surface, in order to decrease the energetic barrier of the proposed rate-limiting step. We thus explore different orientations of RuO 2 , namely the (100), (101) and (001) terminations that have a higher CUS site density and lower oxygen binding energy compared to the (110) surface. Using in situ surface X-ray diffraction measurements we can detect the change in the nature of surface adsorbates just prior to OER for the different orientations. Probing the OER active state, supplemented by density functional theory calculations provides insight into the change of the rate limiting step and reaction mechanism for different orientations. Our work shows that modifying the surface orientation is an effective way to tune the active site density and energetics of key OER intermediates to obtain higher activities. Through this synergistic experimental and computational study, we provide an atomistic understanding of charge transfer processes prior to oxygen evolution and its implications on the oxygen evolution pathway on RuO 2 for different surface orientations.

However, a lack of fundamental understanding of oxide surfaces impedes rational catalyst design for improved activity and stability. Investigation of epitaxial oxide thin films allows quantification of the intrinsic activity, as well as examination of their chemical speciation in an aqueous environment using ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS). We couple electrochemical studies of epitaxial La 1-x Sr x CoO 3 -δ films with in situ and operando AP-XPS to investigate the surface chemistry and electronic structure. By quantifying the formation of hydroxyl (OH) groups in situ , we compare the relative affinity of different surfaces for this key reaction intermediate in oxygen electrocatalysis. Operando measurements of La 0.8 Sr 0.2 CoO 3 -δ in alkaline electrolyte indicate that the surface is stable during OER and behaves as a metal, with the voltage drop confined to the electrolyte. Furthermore, OH and carbonate species persist on the electrode surface even under oxidizing conditions, and may impact the availability of active sites or the binding strength of adsorbed intermediates via adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. The accumulation of OH species with oxidative potentials suggests that, for covalent oxides with facile charge transfer kinetics, the rate of reaction could be limited by proton transfer kinetics. This operando insight highlights the potential importance of carbonates in oxygen electrocatalysis and will help guide modeling of self-consistent oxide electrocatalysts.",

                "abstract": "Rutile Ruthenium Dioxide (RuO 2 ) is a gold standard catalyst for water splitting in acidic solutions 1-3 . It can also undergo fast surface redox reactions in the electrochemically stable potential window of water, making it an ideal material for electrochemical capacitors that can charge and discharge in a much shorter time scale than batteries. However, there is a lack of fundamental understanding of the active sites and atomic scale processes occurring at the oxide-electrolyte interface upon interaction with water as previous work has been confined to the ultra high vacuum environment, and to the thermodynamically stable (110) surface 4 . In this work, we use three different facets of RuO 2 , (110), (100) and (101) to demonstrate how changing the local environment of surface Ru and O atoms can enable tuning the electronic structure of the active site and alter its intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Using synchrotron based ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ surface diffraction on single crystal surfaces coupled with density functional theory calculations, we show that at 1.0 V RHE , water adsorbs molecularly or dissociatively on the coordinatively unsaturated site (CUS), depending on the surface orientation. This is followed by successive deprotonation occuring at potentials greater than 1.0 V RHE . At oxygen evolution potentials (1.5 V RHE ), surface diffraction measurements reveal the presence of an –OO species on the CUS site for the (110) and (100) surface. Computation results show that this –OO group is stabilized by a neighboring –OH group suggesting that the final deprotonation step is rate-limiting. On the other hand, for the (101) surface that binds oxygen more weakly, a completely oxidized surface has been detected, implying a change in the rate-limiting step to the dissociation and deprotonation of the second water molecule on the oxidized surface. The mechanistic insight gained from in situ methods will be used to discuss the difference in OER activity and Tafel slope observed on the different RuO 2 facets. Finally, the results obtained using single crystals will be extended to understanding the distinct redox peaks of RuO 2 nanoparticles in the electrochemically stable potential window of water as well as the nature of intermediates prior to the evolution of oxygen. Thus, by using different experimental and theoretical techniques on model surfaces, this study identifies the active sites for oxygen electrocatalysis and demonstrates how catalyst surface structure can be altered to improve OER kinetics.

While the Cs+ density profiles at the potentials close to hydrogen evolution reaction are similar, the hydration layers intervening the surface and the Cs+ layer on RuO2 surfaces are significantly denser than the hydration layer on Pt(111) surface possibly due to the oxygen termination of RuO2 surfaces. We also discuss in-plane ordering in the Stern layer on Pt(111) surface.",

                "title": "Towards Active and Stable Bifunctional NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Catalysts for O<sub>2</sub> Evolution and Reduction in Alkaline Media",
                "abstract": "It is particularly challenging to find a bifunctional catalyst capable of accelerating both the O 2 evolution reaction (OER) and O 2 reduction reaction (ORR) in aqueous solutions. The discovery of such a material would bring reversible fuel cells and metal air batteries much closer to technological fruition. However, in a real device, such a catalyst will need to retain its activity across an enormous potential window of at least 1 V over several years. To the best of our knowledge, little is known about the factors controlling the stability of bifunctional catalysts. In this contribution, we investigate the electrochemical activity and stability of a NiCo 2 O 4 catalyst, synthesized at Johnson Matthey as part of EU funded project FLOWCAMP. Using post-mortem techniques, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we provide experimental evidence about catalyst deactivation mechanisms. Results will also include a spectroelectrochemical in-situ UV-Vis study, that provides insights to the reaction mechanism for the OER. Lastly, the activity and stability of NiCo 2 O 4 catalysts is also evaluated in oxygen-electrode prototypes and characterized in a half-cell configuration. In figure 1 is shown the ORR and OER activity of NiCo 2 O 4 before and after accelerated degradation tests (ADT), in rotating disk electrode (RDE) configuration, employing three different electrochemical potential windows: i) 0.6 V RHE - 1 V RHE ; ii) 0.6 V RHE - 1.7 V RHE ; and iii) V RHE - 1.7 V RHE . As seen by the blue lines, significant ORR deactivation is observed after cycling across both ORR and OER potentials, whereas a 6% decrease in ORR current at 0.7 V RHE is observed after cycling for 1 hour within the ORR potential window. At the same time, degradation is accompanied by significant redox peak changes, as observed in the inset of Figure 1, which could indicate structural changes occurring during the OER. Post-mortem ICP-MS results indicate that catalyst dissolution accompanies this transformation during the OER. Alongside, in-situ UV-vis experiments identified changes in redox species as a function of applied potential, which are further correlated with the electrochemical current to determine the reaction order with respect to the amount of surface oxidized states. In this presentation, I will clarify the factors that control the activity and stability of NiCo 2 O 4 catalysts, by coupling electrochemical measurements with in-situ UV-vis, and post mortem characterization techniques. In my talk, I will focus on understanding the causes for deactivation of the ORR current, which will aid further design of stable ORR and OER catalysts in alkaline media.

                "abstract": "Water oxidation is the step limiting the efficiency of electrocatalytic hydrogen production from water. Spectroelectro-chemical analyzes are employed to make a direct comparison of water oxidation reaction kinetics between a molecu-lar catalyst, the dimeric iridium catalyst [Ir2(pyalc)2(H2O)4-(µ-O)]2+ (IrMolecular, pyalc = 2-(2’pyridinyl)-2-propanolate) immobilized on a mesoporous indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, with that of an heterogenous electrocatalyst, an amorphous hydrous iridium (IrOx) film. For both systems, four analogous redox states were detected, with the for-mation of Ir(4+)-Ir(5+) being the potential-determining step in both cases. However, the two systems exhibit distinct water oxidation reaction kinetics, with potential-independent first-order kinetics for IrMolecular contrasting with poten-tial-dependent kinetics for IrOx. This is attributed to water oxidation on the heterogenous catalyst requiring co-operative effects between neighboring oxidized Ir centers. The ability of IrMolecular to drive water oxidation without such co-operative effects is explained by the specific coordination environment around its Ir centers. These distinc-tions between molecular and heterogenous reaction kinetics are shown to explain the differences observed in their water oxidation electrocatalytic performance under different potential conditions.",

                "title": "X-Ray Crystal Truncation Rod Studies of Electrochemical Double Layers",
                "abstract": "Electrochemical double layers (EDL) is traditionally described as diffuse distributions of cations and anions, proposed in Gouy and Chapman (GC) model[1] and further developed extensively over decades largely based on voltammetry measurements. However, the GC model is suspected to break down at large potentials, because it predicts the unlimited rise in differential capacitance. Stern suggested long ago that there should be a layer with a finite ion density, known as ‘Stern layer’[2]. While it is generally accepted that Gouy-Chapman model or its modified versions describe well electrochemical interphase structures, recent studies of Pt(111) surface in CsF solution using a model-independent direct inversion method[3] have shown that Stern layer forms over the large double-layer potential range on Pt(111) surface.[4] In this talk, we present synchrotron x-ray observation of Electrochemical Stern layers on the surfaces of RuO 2 single crystals in 0.1 M CsF electrolyte. It is of fundamental importance to study if Stern layer forms on electrode surfaces other than Pt(111). In this case, we will examine RuO2 surfaces and compare the results to that of Pt(111) surface. RuO2 is chosen for several reasons. First, it is a well-studied system because of its oxygen evolution reactions and we are familiar with the structure because of our previous studies.[5,6] Second, it is an oxide with oxygen terminated while Pt is a pure metal. Third, the surfaces of RuO2 are squares or rectangles while that Pt(111) surface is triangles. The Stern layers formed at the interfaces of RuO 2 (110) and (100) are compared to the previously reported Stern layer on Pt(111). [4] While the Cs+ density profiles at the potentials close to hydrogen evolution reactions are similar, the hydration layers intervening the surface and the Cs+ layer are significantly denser on RuO 2 surfaces than that on Pt(111) surface, reflecting the oxygen termination of RuO 2 surfaces. The overall similarities between Stern layers on ruthenium surfaces and platinum surface suggest the universal presence of Stern layers in all well-defined solid-electrolyte interfaces. [1] Bard, A.

                "abstract": "Improving the kinetics of oxygen electrocatalysis is key to increasing the efficiency of hydrogen production from renewable sources, production of carbon-neutral fuels such as ethylene and rechargeable metal-air batteries 1 . Metal oxides exhibit state-of-the-art activity, but fundamental atomic-level insights into the reaction mechanism are often unknown. Particularly, various differences between materials, including the differences in active surface area, chemical state of the metal cations, fractional coverage of oxidized species and the range of ordered structure, renders it difficult to identify the origin of the differing activity. Thus far, ambiguities in measuring the number of sites participating in the reaction have prevented the accurate measurement of intrinsic catalytic activity, or turnover frequency. Furthermore, while recent studies have indicated that the density of oxidized species can enhance reaction rates on metal oxides surfaces via cooperative effects between adjacent adsorbates 2-4 , extending these mechanistic implications to a range of oxides remains a challenge. In this talk, I will present developments in time-resolved optical spectroscopy to identify the density of different oxidized species as a function of potential and establish how this controls the reaction kinetics. These results will be combined with (i) X-ray absorption spectroscopy to measure the oxidation state and coordination of the active site (ii) time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to measure the depth of redox active states 5 and (iii) on chip electrochemical mass spectrometry to measure the degree of lattice oxygen participation. As an example, a range of iridium-based catalysts – namely monolayers of molecular iridium dimers 6 , amorphous 7 and crystalline oxides will be compared for the water oxidation reaction. For all the catalysts investigated, three redox transitions can be observed, and the physical origin of these redox processes can be assigned using density functional theory studies. Although similar oxidized species are found to accumulate at water oxidation potentials, the correlation between the density of oxidized species and water oxidation kinetics is very different. On molecular catalysts, there is limited interaction between isolated iridium centres, and thus the intrinsic activity per oxidized site is invariant with potential 5 . On the contrary, for heterogeneous oxide catalysts, a high degree of cooperative effects results in faster kinetics with increasing accumulation of oxidized species on the surface. The potential for accumulation for oxidized species and the degree of interaction of these oxidized species will be compared for the amorphous and crystalline oxides. Therefore, through this work, I will highlight the power of operando time-resolved spectroscopy in unravelling the critical role of oxidized species in facilitating water oxidation kinetics.

                "abstract": "Hydrous iridium oxides (IrOx) are the best oxygen evolution electrocatalysts available for operation in acidic environments. In this study, we employ time-resolved operando spectroelectrochemistry to investigate the redox states kinetics of IrOx electrocatalyst films for both water and hydrogen peroxide oxidation. Three different redox species involving Ir3+, Ir4+ and Ir4.x are identified spectroscopically and their concentrations are quantified as a function of applied potential. The generation of Ir4.x+ states is found to be the potential determining step for catalytic water oxidation, whilst H2O2 oxidation is observed to be driven by the generation of Ir4+ states. The reaction kinetics for water oxidation, determined from the optical signal decays at open circuit, accelerate from ~ 20 s to &lt; 0.5 s with increasing applied potential above 1.3V vs. RHE (i.e. TOFs per active Ir state increasing from 0.05 to 2 s-1). In contrast, the reaction kinetics for H2O2 are found to be almost independent of the applied potential (increasing from 0.1-0.3 s-1 over a wider potential window), indicative of a first order reaction mechanism. These spectroelectrochemical data quantify the increase of both the density of active Ir4.x+ states and the TOFs of these states with applied positive potential, resulting in the observed sharp turn on of catalytic water oxidation current. We reconcile these data with the broader literature while providing a new kinetic insight into IrOx electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms, indicating a first order reaction mechanism for H2O2 oxidation driven by Ir4+ states, and a higher order reaction mechanism involving the co-operative interaction of multiple Ir4.x+ states for water oxidation.",

                "abstract": "This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 °C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).",

                "abstract": "The most recent IPCC assessment has shown an important role for negative emissions technologies (NETs) in limiting global warming to 2 °C cost-effectively. However, a bottom-up, systematic, reproducible, and transparent literature assessment of the different options to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is currently missing. In part 1 of this three-part review on NETs, we assemble a comprehensive set of the relevant literature so far published, focusing on seven technologies: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation and reforestation, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering, ocean fertilisation, biochar, and soil carbon sequestration. In this part, part 2 of the review, we present estimates of costs, potentials, and side-effects for these technologies, and qualify them with the authors' assessment. Part 3 reviews the innovation and scaling challenges that must be addressed to realise NETs deployment as a viable climate mitigation strategy. Based on a systematic review of the literature, our best estimates for sustainable global NET potentials in 2050 are 0.5–3.6 GtCO2 yr−1 for afforestation and reforestation, 0.5–5 GtCO2 yr−1 for BECCS, 0.5–2 GtCO2 yr−1 for biochar, 2–4 GtCO2 yr−1 for enhanced weathering, 0.5–5 GtCO2 yr−1 for DACCS, and up to 5 GtCO2 yr−1 for soil carbon sequestration. Costs vary widely across the technologies, as do their permanency and cumulative potentials beyond 2050. It is unlikely that a single NET will be able to sustainably meet the rates of carbon uptake described in integrated assessment pathways consistent with 1.5 °C of global warming.",

                "abstract": "Studies of global environmental change make extensive use of scenarios to explore how the future can evolve under a consistent set of assumptions. The recently developed Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) create a framework for the study of climate-related scenario outcomes. Their five narratives span a wide range of worlds that vary in their challenges for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Here we provide background on the quantification that has been selected to serve as the reference, or ‘marker’, implementation for SSP2. The SSP2 narrative describes a middle-of-the-road development in the mitigation and adaptation challenges space. We explain how the narrative has been translated into quantitative assumptions in the IIASA Integrated Assessment Modelling Framework. We show that our SSP2 marker implementation occupies a central position for key metrics along the mitigation and adaptation challenge dimensions. For many dimensions the SSP2 marker implementation also reflects an extension of the historical experience, particularly in terms of carbon and energy intensity improvements in its baseline. This leads to a steady emissions increase over the 21st century, with projected end-of-century warming nearing 4 °C relative to preindustrial levels. On the other hand, SSP2 also shows that global-mean temperature increase can be limited to below 2 °C, pending stringent climate policies throughout the world. The added value of the SSP2 marker implementation for the wider scientific community is that it can serve as a starting point to further explore integrated solutions for achieving multiple societal objectives in light of the climate adaptation and mitigation challenges that society could face over the 21st century.",

Despite several assessments, the current knowledge on NETs is still diffuse and incomplete, but also growing fast. Here, we synthesize a comprehensive body of NETs literature, using scientometric tools and performing an in-depth assessment of the quantitative and qualitative evidence therein. We clarify the role of NETs in climate change mitigation scenarios, their ethical implications, as well as the challenges involved in bringing the various NETs to the market and scaling them up in time. There are six major findings arising from our assessment: first, keeping warming below 1.5 °C requires the large-scale deployment of NETs, but this dependency can still be kept to a minimum for the 2 °C warming limit. Second, accounting for economic and biophysical limits, we identify relevant potentials for all NETs except ocean fertilization. Third, any single NET is unlikely to sustainably achieve the large NETs deployment observed in many 1.5 °C and 2 °C mitigation scenarios. Yet, portfolios of multiple NETs, each deployed at modest scales, could be invaluable for reaching the climate goals. Fourth, a substantial gap exists between the upscaling and rapid diffusion of NETs implied in scenarios and progress in actual innovation and deployment. If NETs are required at the scales currently discussed, the resulting urgency of implementation is currently neither reflected in science nor policy. Fifth, NETs face severe barriers to implementation and are only weakly incentivized so far. Finally, we identify distinct ethical discourses relevant for NETs, but highlight the need to root them firmly in the available evidence in order to render such discussions relevant in practice.",

Solar forcing is the only known natural forcing acting to warm the climate over this period but it has increased much less than GHG forcing, and the observed pattern of long-term tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling is not consistent with the expected response to solar irradiance variations.

                "abstract": "Abstract. Robust appraisals of climate impacts at different levels of global-mean temperature increase are vital to guide assessments of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The 2015 Paris Agreement includes a two-headed temperature goal: \"holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C\". Despite the prominence of these two temperature limits, a comprehensive overview of the differences in climate impacts at these levels is still missing. Here we provide an assessment of key impacts of climate change at warming levels of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, including extreme weather events, water availability, agricultural yields, sea-level rise and risk of coral reef loss. Our results reveal substantial differences in impacts between a 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming that are highly relevant for the assessment of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. For heat-related extremes, the additional 0.5 °C increase in global-mean temperature marks the difference between events at the upper limit of present-day natural variability and a new climate regime, particularly in tropical regions. Similarly, this warming difference is likely to be decisive for the future of tropical coral reefs. In a scenario with an end-of-century warming of 2 °C, virtually all tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperature-induced bleaching from 2050 onwards. This fraction is reduced to about 90 % in 2050 and projected to decline to 70 % by 2100 for a 1.5 °C scenario. Analyses of precipitation-related impacts reveal distinct regional differences and hot-spots of change emerge. Regional reduction in median water availability for the Mediterranean is found to nearly double from 9 % to 17 % between 1.5 °C and 2 °C, and the projected lengthening of regional dry spells increases from 7 to 11 %. Projections for agricultural yields differ between crop types as well as world regions. While some (in particular high-latitude) regions may benefit, tropical regions like West Africa, South-East Asia, as well as Central and northern South America are projected to face substantial local yield reductions, particularly for wheat and maize. Best estimate sea-level rise projections based on two illustrative scenarios indicate a 50 cm rise by 2100 relative to year 2000-levels for a 2 °C scenario, and about 10 cm lower levels for a 1.5 °C scenario. In a 1.5 °C scenario, the rate of sea-level rise in 2100 would be reduced by about 30 % compared to a 2 °C scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of regional differentiation to assess both future climate risks and different vulnerabilities to incremental increases in global-mean temperature. The article provides a consistent and comprehensive assessment of existing projections and a good basis for future work on refining our understanding of the difference between impacts at 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming.",

One of these challenges is energy; thus, the SDGs have become paramount for energy policy-making. Yet, while governments throughout the world have already declared the SDGs to be 'integrated and indivisible', there are still knowledge gaps surrounding how the interactions between the energy SDG targets and those of the non-energy-focused SDGs might play out in different contexts. In this review, we report on a large-scale assessment of the relevant energy literature, which we conducted to better our understanding of key energy-related interactions between SDGs, as well as their context-dependencies (relating to time, geography, governance, technology, and directionality). By (i) evaluating the nature and strength of the interactions identified, (ii) indicating the robustness of the evidence base, the agreement of that evidence, and our confidence in it, and (iii) highlighting critical areas where better understanding is needed or context dependencies should be considered, our review points to potential ways forward for both the policy making and scientific communities. First, we find that positive interactions between the SDGs outweigh the negative ones, both in number and magnitude. Second, of relevance for the scientific community, in order to fill knowledge gaps in critical areas, there is an urgent need for interdisciplinary research geared toward developing new data, scientific tools, and fresh perspectives. Third, of relevance for policy-making, wider efforts to promote policy coherence and integrated assessments are required to address potential policy spillovers across sectors, sustainability domains, and geographic and temporal boundaries. The task of conducting comprehensive science-to-policy assessments covering all SDGs, such as for the UN's Global Sustainable Development Report, remains manageable pending the availability of systematic reviews focusing on a limited number of SDG dimensions in each case.",

Halting global warming thus requires virtually zero annual CO2 emissions at some point. Policymakers have now incorporated this concept in the negotiating text for a new global climate agreement, but confusion remains about concepts like carbon neutrality, climate neutrality, full decarbonization, and net zero carbon or net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here we clarify these concepts, discuss their appropriateness to serve as a long-term global benchmark for achieving temperature targets, and provide a detailed quantification. We find that with current pledges and for a likely (>66%) chance of staying below 2 °C, the scenario literature suggests net zero CO2 emissions between 2060 and 2070, with net negative CO2 emissions thereafter. Because of residual non-CO2 emissions, net zero is always reached later for total GHG emissions than for CO2. Net zero emissions targets are a useful focal point for policy, linking a global temperature target and socio-economic pathways to a necessary long-term limit on cumulative CO2 emissions.",

The pandemic caused drastic fluctuations in energy demand, oil price shocks, disruptions in energy supply chains, and hampered energy investments, while the war left the world with energy price hikes and energy security challenges. The long-term impacts of these crises on low-carbon energy transitions and mitigation of climate change are still uncertain but are slowly emerging. This paper analyzes the impacts throughout the energy system, including upstream fuel supply, renewable energy investments, demand for energy services, and implications for energy equity, by reviewing recent studies and consulting experts in the field. We find that both crises initially appeared as opportunities for low-carbon energy transitions: the pandemic by showing the extent of lifestyle and behavioral change in a short period and the role of science-based policy advice, and the war by highlighting the need for greater energy diversification and reliance on local, renewable energy sources. However, the early evidence suggests that policymaking worldwide is focused on short-term, seemingly quicker solutions, such as supporting the incumbent energy industry in the post-pandemic era to save the economy and looking for new fossil fuel supply routes for enhancing energy security following the war. As such, the fossil fuel industry may emerge even stronger after these energy crises creating new lock-ins. This implies that the public sentiment against dependency on fossil fuels may end as a lost opportunity to translate into actions toward climate-friendly energy transitions, without ambitious plans for phasing out such fuels altogether. We propose policy recommendations to overcome these challenges toward achieving resilient and sustainable energy systems, mostly driven by energy services.",

                "abstract": "Understanding the interplay between multiple climate change risks and socioeconomic development is increasingly required to inform effective actions to manage these risks and pursue sustainable development. We calculate a set of 14 impact indicators at different levels of global mean temperature (GMT) change and socioeconomic development covering water, energy and land sectors from an ensemble of global climate, integrated assessment and impact models. The analysis includes changes in drought intensity and water stress index, cooling demand change and heat event exposure, habitat degradation and crop yield, amongst others. To investigate exposure to multi-sector climate impacts, these are combined with gridded socioeconomic projections of population and those 'vulnerable to poverty' from three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) (income <$10/day, currently 4.2 billion people). We show that global exposure to multi-sector risks approximately doubles between 1.5 °C and 2 °C GMT change, doubles again with 3 °C GMT change and is ~6x between the best and worst cases (SSP1/1.5 °C vs SSP3/3 °C, 0.8–4.7bi). For populations vulnerable to poverty, the exposure is an order of magnitude greater (8–32x) in the high poverty and inequality scenarios (SSP3) compared to sustainable socioeconomic development (SSP1). Whilst 85%–95% of global exposure falls to Asian and African regions, they have 91%–98% of the exposed and vulnerable population (depending on SSP/GMT combination), approximately half of which in South Asia. In higher warming scenarios, African regions have growing proportion of the global exposed and vulnerable population, ranging from 7%–17% at 1.5 °C, doubling to 14%–30% at 2 °C and again to 27%–51% at 3 °C. Finally, beyond 2 °C and at higher risk thresholds, the world's poorest are disproportionately impacted, particularly in cases (SSP3) of high inequality in Africa and southern Asia. Sustainable development that reduces poverty, mitigates emissions and meets targets in the water, energy and land sectors has the potential for order-of-magnitude scale reductions in multi-sector climate risk for the most vulnerable.",

The Zero Emissions Commitment (ZEC) is the change in global mean temperature expected to occur following the cessation of net CO2 emissions and as such is a critical parameter for calculating the remaining carbon budget. The Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP) was established to gain a better understanding of the potential magnitude and sign of ZEC, in addition to the processes that underlie this metric. A total of 18 Earth system models of both full and intermediate complexity participated in ZECMIP. All models conducted an experiment where atmospheric CO2 concentration increases exponentially until 1000 PgC has been emitted. Thereafter emissions are set to zero and models are configured to allow free evolution of atmospheric CO2 concentration. Many models conducted additional second-priority simulations with different cumulative emission totals and an alternative idealized emissions pathway with a gradual transition to zero emissions. The inter-model range of ZEC 50 years after emissions cease for the 1000 PgC experiment is −0.36 to 0.29 ∘C, with a model ensemble mean of −0.07 ∘C, median of −0.05 ∘C, and standard deviation of 0.19 ∘C. Models exhibit a wide variety of behaviours after emissions cease, with some models continuing to warm for decades to millennia and others cooling substantially. Analysis shows that both the carbon uptake by the ocean and the terrestrial biosphere are important for counteracting the warming effect from the reduction in ocean heat uptake in the decades after emissions cease. This warming effect is difficult to constrain due to high uncertainty in the efficacy of ocean heat uptake. Overall, the most likely value of ZEC on multi-decadal timescales is close to zero, consistent with previous model experiments and simple theory.",

We estimate median sea-level rise between 0.7 and 1.2 m, if net-zero greenhouse gas emissions are sustained until 2300, varying with the pathway of emissions during this century. Temperature stabilization below 2 °C is insufficient to hold median sea-level rise until 2300 below 1.5 m. We find that each 5-year delay in near-term peaking of CO2 emissions increases median year 2300 sea-level rise estimates by ca. 0.2 m, and extreme sea-level rise estimates at the 95th percentile by up to 1 m.

                "abstract": "Natural carbon sinks currently absorb approximately half of the anthropogenic CO2 emitted by fossil fuel burning, cement production and land-use change. However, this airborne fraction may change in the future depending on the emissions scenario. An important issue in developing carbon budgets to achieve climate stabilisation targets is the behaviour of natural carbon sinks, particularly under low emissions mitigation scenarios as required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. A key requirement for low carbon pathways is to quantify the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies which will be strongly affected by carbon cycle feedbacks. Here we find that Earth system models suggest significant weakening, even potential reversal, of the ocean and land sinks under future low emission scenarios. For the RCP2.6 concentration pathway, models project land and ocean sinks to weaken to 0.8 ± 0.9 and 1.1 ± 0.3 GtC yr−1 respectively for the second half of the 21st century and to −0.4 ± 0.4 and 0.1 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1 respectively for the second half of the 23rd century. Weakening of natural carbon sinks will hinder the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies and therefore increase their required deployment to achieve a given climate stabilisation target. We introduce a new metric, the perturbation airborne fraction, to measure and assess the effectiveness of negative emissions.",

Under a global 1.5°C scenario, warming in the Antarctic Peninsula is likely increase the number of days above 0°C, with up to 130 of such days each year in the northern Peninsula. Ocean turbulence will increase, making the circumpolar deep water (CDW) both warmer and shallower, delivering heat to the sea surface and to coastal margins. Thinning and recession of marine margins of glaciers and ice caps is expected to accelerate to terrestrial limits, increasing iceberg production, after which glacier retreat may slow on land. Ice shelves will experience continued increase in meltwater production and consequent structural change, but not imminent regional collapses. Marine biota can respond in multiple ways to climatic changes, with effects complicated by past resource extraction activities. Southward distribution shifts have been observed in multiple taxa during the last century and these are likely to continue. Exposed (ice free) terrestrial areas will expand, providing new habitats for native and non-native organisms, but with a potential loss of genetic diversity. While native terrestrial biota are likely to benefit from modest warming, the greatest threat to native biodiversity is from non-native terrestrial species.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Committed warming describes how much future warming can be expected from historical emissions due to inertia in the climate system. It is usually defined in terms of the level of warming above the present for an abrupt halt of emissions. Owing to socioeconomic constraints, this situation is unlikely, so we focus on the committed warming from present-day fossil fuel assets. Here we show that if carbon-intensive infrastructure is phased out at the end of its design lifetime from the end of 2018, there is a 64% chance that peak global mean temperature rise remains below 1.5 °C. Delaying mitigation until 2030 considerably reduces the likelihood that 1.5 °C would be attainable even if the rate of fossil fuel retirement was accelerated. Although the challenges laid out by the Paris Agreement are daunting, we indicate 1.5 °C remains possible and is attainable with ambitious and immediate emission reduction across all sectors.",

                "abstract": "Abstract. Reduced-complexity climate models (RCMs) are critical in the policy and decision making space, and are directly used within multiple Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports to complement the results of more comprehensive Earth system models. To date, evaluation of RCMs has been limited to a few independent studies. Here we introduce a systematic evaluation of RCMs in the form of the Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project (RCMIP). We expect RCMIP will extend over multiple phases, with Phase 1 being the first. In Phase 1, we focus on the RCMs' global-mean temperature responses, comparing them to observations, exploring the extent to which they emulate more complex models and considering how the relationship between temperature and cumulative emissions of CO2 varies across the RCMs. Our work uses experiments which mirror those found in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), which focuses on complex Earth system and atmosphere–ocean general circulation models. Using both scenario-based and idealised experiments, we examine RCMs' global-mean temperature response under a range of forcings. We find that the RCMs can all reproduce the approximately 1 ∘C of warming since pre-industrial times, with varying representations of natural variability, volcanic eruptions and aerosols. We also find that RCMs can emulate the global-mean temperature response of CMIP models to within a root-mean-square error of 0.2 ∘C over a range of experiments. Furthermore, we find that, for the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP)-based scenario pairs that share the same IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)-consistent stratospheric-adjusted radiative forcing, the RCMs indicate higher effective radiative forcings for the SSP-based scenarios and correspondingly higher temperatures when run with the same climate settings. In our idealised setup of RCMs with a climate sensitivity of 3 ∘C, the difference for the ssp585–rcp85 pair by 2100 is around 0.23∘C(±0.12 ∘C) due to a difference in effective radiative forcings between the two scenarios. Phase 1 demonstrates the utility of RCMIP's open-source infrastructure, paving the way for further phases of RCMIP to build on the research presented here and deepen our understanding of RCMs.",

                "abstract": "Abstract. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments are the trusted source of scientific evidence for climate negotiations taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including the first global stocktake under the Paris Agreement that will conclude at COP28 in December 2023. Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system. However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5–10 years, creating potential for an information gap between report cycles. We follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, surface temperature changes, the Earth's energy imbalance, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of this effort, grounded in an open data, open science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8000192, Smith et al., 2023a). As they are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel. The indicators show that human-induced warming reached 1.14 [0.9 to 1.4] ∘C averaged over the 2013–2022 decade and 1.26 [1.0 to 1.6] ∘C in 2022. Over the 2013–2022 period, human-induced warming has been increasing at an unprecedented rate of over 0.2 ∘C per decade. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of greenhouse gas emissions being at an all-time high of 54 ± 5.3 GtCO2e over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that increases in greenhouse gas emissions have slowed, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for human influence on climate.",

                "abstract": "Abstract. While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) physical science reports usually assess a handful of future scenarios, the Working Group III contribution on climate mitigation to the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6 WGIII) assesses hundreds to thousands of future emissions scenarios. A key task in WGIII is to assess the global mean temperature outcomes of these scenarios in a consistent manner, given the challenge that the emissions scenarios from different integrated assessment models (IAMs) come with different sectoral and gas-to-gas coverage and cannot all be assessed consistently by complex Earth system models. In this work, we describe the “climate-assessment” workflow and its methods, including infilling of missing emissions and emissions harmonisation as applied to 1202 mitigation scenarios in AR6 WGIII. We evaluate the global mean temperature projections and effective radiative forcing (ERF) characteristics of climate emulators FaIRv1.6.2 and MAGICCv7.5.3 and use the CICERO simple climate model (CICERO-SCM) for sensitivity analysis. We discuss the implied overshoot severity of the mitigation pathways using overshoot degree years and look at emissions and temperature characteristics of scenarios compatible with one possible interpretation of the Paris Agreement. We find that the lowest class of emissions scenarios that limit global warming to “1.5 ∘C (with a probability of greater than 50 %) with no or limited overshoot” includes 97 scenarios for MAGICCv7.5.3 and 203 for FaIRv1.6.2. For the MAGICCv7.5.3 results, “limited overshoot” typically implies exceedance of median temperature projections of up to about 0.1 ∘C for up to a few decades before returning to below 1.5 ∘C by or before the year 2100. For more than half of the scenarios in this category that comply with three criteria for being “Paris-compatible”, including net-zero or net-negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, median temperatures decline by about 0.3–0.4 ∘C after peaking at 1.5–1.6 ∘C in 2035–2055. We compare the methods applied in AR6 with the methods used for SR1.5 and discuss their implications. This article also introduces a “climate-assessment” Python package which allows for fully reproducing the IPCC AR6 WGIII temperature assessment. This work provides a community tool for assessing the temperature outcomes of emissions pathways and provides a basis for further work such as extending the workflow to include downscaling of climate characteristics to a regional level and calculating impacts.",

We estimate a median TCRE of 0.44 °C and 5–95% range of 0.32–0.62 °C per 1000 GtCO 2 emitted. Considering only geophysical uncertainties, our median estimate of the 1.5 °C remaining carbon budget is 440 GtCO 2 from 2020 onwards, with a range of 230–670 GtCO 2 , (for a 67–33% chance of not exceeding the target).

                "abstract": "Over the last decades, climate science has evolved rapidly across multiple expert domains. Our best tools to capture state-of-the-art knowledge in an internally self-consistent modeling framework are the increasingly complex fully coupled Earth System Models (ESMs). However, computational limitations and the structural rigidity of ESMs mean that the full range of uncertainties across multiple domains are difficult to capture with ESMs alone. The tools of choice are instead more computationally efficient reduced complexity models (RCMs), which are structurally flexible and can span the response dynamics across a range of domain-specific models and ESM experiments. Here we present Phase 2 of the Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project (RCMIP Phase 2), the first comprehensive intercomparison of RCMs that are probabilistically calibrated with key benchmark ranges from specialized research communities. Unsurprisingly, but crucially, we find that models which have been constrained to reflect the key benchmarks better reflect the key benchmarks. Under the low-emissions SSP1-1.9 scenario, across the RCMs, median peak warming projections range from 1.3 to 1.7°C (relative to 1850-1900, using an observationally based historical warming estimate of 0.8°C between 1850-1900 and 1995-2014). Further developing methodologies to constrain these projection uncertainties seems paramount given the international community's goal to contain warming to below 1.5°C above preindustrial in the long-term. Our findings suggest that users of RCMs should carefully evaluate their RCM, specifically its skill against key benchmarks and consider the need to include projections benchmarks either from ESM results or other assessments to reduce divergence in future projections.",

Here we evaluate recent RCB assessments by the IPCC and present more recent data, calculation refinements and robustness checks that increase confidence in them. We conclude that the RCB for a 50% chance of keeping warming to 1.5 °C is around 250 GtCO 2 as of January 2023, equal to around six years of current CO 2 emissions. For a 50% chance of 2 °C the RCB is around 1,200 GtCO 2 . Key uncertainties affecting RCB estimates are the contribution of non-CO 2 emissions, which depends on socioeconomic projections as much as on geophysical uncertainty, and potential warming after net zero CO 2 .",

Here we propose a pathway classification that aims to comprehensively reflect the climate criteria set out in the Paris Agreement. We show how such an approach allows for a fully consistent interpretation of the Agreement. For Paris Agreement compatible pathways, we report net zero CO 2 and greenhouse gas emissions around 2050 and 2065, respectively. We illustrate how pathway design criteria not rooted in the Paris Agreement, such as the 2100 temperature level, result in scenario outcomes wherein about 6 - 24% higher deployment (interquartile range) of carbon dioxide removal is observed.",

Human-induced warming has been increasing at a rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record, reaching 0.26 [0.2–0.4] °C per decade over 2014–2023.

But how confident are we that when we stop carbon emissions, we also stop global warming? The Zero Emissions Commitment (ZEC) quantifies how much warming or cooling we can expect following a complete cessation of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. To date, the best estimate by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report is zero change, though with substantial uncertainty. In this article, we present an overview of the changes expected in major Earth system processes after net zero and their potential impact on global surface temperature, providing an outlook toward building a more confident assessment of ZEC in the decades to come. We propose a structure to guide research into ZEC and associated changes in the climate, separating the impacts expected over decades, centuries, and millennia. As we look ahead at the century billed to mark the end of net anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, we ask: what is the prospect of a stable climate in a post-net zero world?",

However, estimates of these budgets for limiting warming to 1.5 °C and well-below 2 °C include assumptions about how much warming can be expected from non-CO 2 emissions. Here, we uncover the non-CO 2 emissions assumptions that underlie the latest remaining carbon budget estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and quantify the implication of the world pursuing alternative higher or lower emissions. We consider contributions of methane, nitrous oxide, fluorinated gases, and aerosols and show how pursuing inadequate methane emission reductions causes remaining carbon budgets compatible with the Paris Agreement temperature limits to be exhausted today, effectively putting achievement of the Paris Agreement out of reach.",

                "abstract": "Limiting global warming to 2 °C will likely entail the complete phase-out of coal-based electricity generation without carbon capture and storage (CCS). The timing and rate of this phase-out will depend on the stringency of near-term climate policy and will have important implications for the stranding of coal power plant capacity without CCS. The objectives of this paper are to better understand the relationship between near-term climate policy and stranded coal capacity (assuming a long-term goal of limiting warming to 2 °C) and to explore strategies for reducing stranded capacity. Our analysis suggests that strengthening near-term climate policy (i.e., lowering the global greenhouse gas emission target in 2030) generally reduces stranded coal capacity and its costs. An effective strategy for reducing stranded capacity is to minimize new construction of coal capacity without CCS, which can be accomplished by reducing electricity demand through energy intensity improvements and/or by keeping existing plants operating through lifetime extensions. Another strategy, providing emission exemptions for pre-existing coal plants (i.e., grandfathering), would eliminate stranded capacity, but also decreases the likelihood of achieving the 2 °C target. Finally, the ability of CCS retrofits to significantly reduce stranded capacity depends on how quickly the technology can be deployed.",

                "abstract": "Anthropogenic global warming is driven by emissions of a wide variety of radiative forcers ranging from very short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), like black carbon, to very long-lived, like CO2. These species are often released from common sources and are therefore intricately linked. However, for reasons of simplification, this CO2-SLCF linkage was often disregarded in long-term projections of earlier studies. Here we explicitly account for CO2-SLCF linkages and show that the short- and long-term climate effects of many SLCF measures consistently become smaller in scenarios that keep warming to below 2 °C relative to preindustrial levels. Although long-term mitigation of methane and hydrofluorocarbons are integral parts of 2 °C scenarios, early action on these species mainly influences near-term temperatures and brings small benefits for limiting maximum warming relative to comparable reductions taking place later. Furthermore, we find that maximum 21st-century warming in 2 °C-consistent scenarios is largely unaffected by additional black-carbon-related measures because key emission sources are already phased-out through CO2 mitigation. Our study demonstrates the importance of coherently considering CO2-SLCF coevolutions. Failing to do so leads to strongly and consistently overestimating the effect of SLCF measures in climate stabilization scenarios. Our results reinforce that SLCF measures are to be considered complementary rather than a substitute for early and stringent CO2 mitigation. Near-term SLCF measures do not allow for more time for CO2 mitigation. We disentangle and resolve the distinct benefits across different species and therewith facilitate an integrated strategy for mitigating both short and long-term climate change.",

                "abstract": "Abstract. The amount of additional future temperature change following a complete cessation of CO2 emissions is a measure of the unrealized warming to which we are committed due to CO2 already emitted to the atmosphere. This “zero emissions commitment” (ZEC) is also an important quantity when estimating the remaining carbon budget – a limit on the total amount of CO2 emissions consistent with limiting global mean temperature at a particular level. In the recent IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 ∘C, the carbon budget framework used to calculate the remaining carbon budget for 1.5 ∘C included the assumption that the ZEC due to CO2 emissions is negligible and close to zero. Previous research has shown significant uncertainty even in the sign of the ZEC. To close this knowledge gap, we propose the Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP), which will quantify the amount of unrealized temperature change that occurs after CO2 emissions cease and investigate the geophysical drivers behind this climate response. Quantitative information on ZEC is a key gap in our knowledge, and one that will not be addressed by currently planned CMIP6 simulations, yet it is crucial for verifying whether carbon budgets need to be adjusted to account for any unrealized temperature change resulting from past CO2 emissions. We request only one top-priority simulation from comprehensive general circulation Earth system models (ESMs) and Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) – a branch from the 1 % CO2 run with CO2 emissions set to zero at the point of 1000 PgC of total CO2 emissions in the simulation – with the possibility for additional simulations, if resources allow. ZECMIP is part of CMIP6, under joint sponsorship by C4MIP and CDRMIP, with associated experiment names to enable data submissions to the Earth System Grid Federation.

                "abstract": "In this \"Grand Challenges\" paper, we review how the carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2 has changed since the Industrial Revolution due to human activities and their influence on the natural carbon cycle, and we provide new estimates of possible future changes for a range of scenarios. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and land use change reduce the ratio of 13C/12C in atmospheric CO2 (δ13CO2). This is because 12C is preferentially assimilated during photosynthesis and δ13C in plant-derived carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and fossil fuels is lower than atmospheric δ13CO2. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion also reduce the ratio of 14C/C in atmospheric CO2 (Δ14CO2) because 14C is absent in million-year-old fossil fuels, which have been stored for much longer than the radioactive decay time of 14C. Atmospheric Δ14CO2 rapidly increased in the 1950s to 1960s because of 14C produced during nuclear bomb testing. The resulting trends in δ13C and Δ14C in atmospheric CO2 are influenced not only by these human emissions but also by natural carbon exchanges that mix carbon between the atmosphere and ocean and terrestrial ecosystems. This mixing caused Δ14CO2 to return toward preindustrial levels in the first few decades after the spike from nuclear testing. More recently, as the bomb 14C excess is now mostly well mixed with the decadally overturning carbon reservoirs, fossil fuel emissions have become the main factor driving further decreases in atmospheric Δ14CO2. For δ13CO2, in addition to exchanges between reservoirs, the extent to which 12C is preferentially assimilated during photosynthesis appears to have increased, slowing down the recent δ13CO2 trend slightly. A new compilation of ice core and flask δ13CO2 observations indicates that the decline in δ13CO2 since the preindustrial period is less than some prior estimates, which may have incorporated artifacts owing to offsets from different laboratories' measurements. Atmospheric observations of δ13CO2 have been used to investigate carbon fluxes and the functioning of plants, and they are used for comparison with δ13C in other materials such as tree rings. Atmospheric observations of Δ14CO2 have been used to quantify the rate of air-sea gas exchange and ocean circulation, and the rate of net primary production and the turnover time of carbon in plant material and soils. Atmospheric observations of Δ14CO2 are also used for comparison with Δ14C in other materials in many fields such as archaeology, forensics, and physiology. Another major application is the assessment of regional emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion using Δ14CO2 observations and models. In the future, δ13CO2 and Δ14CO2 will continue to change. The sign and magnitude of the changes are mainly determined by global fossil fuel emissions. We present here simulations of future δ13CO2 and Δ14CO2 for six scenarios based on the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) from the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Applications using atmospheric δ13CO2 and Δ14CO2 observations in carbon cycle science and many other fields will be affected by these future changes. We recommend an increased effort toward making coordinated measurements of δ13C and Δ14C across the Earth System and for further development of isotopic modeling and model-data analysis tools.",

                "abstract": "The main goal of the Paris Agreement as stated in Article 2 is ‘holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C’. Article 4 points to this long-term goal and the need to achieve ‘balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases'. This statement on ‘greenhouse gas balance’ is subject to interpretation, and clarifications are needed to make it operational for national and international climate policies. We study possible interpretations from a scientific perspective and analyse their climatic implications. We clarify how the implications for individual gases depend on the metrics used to relate them. We show that the way in which balance is interpreted, achieved and maintained influences temperature outcomes. Achieving and maintaining net-zero CO 2 -equivalent emissions conventionally calculated using GWP 100 (100-year global warming potential) and including substantial positive contributions from short-lived climate-forcing agents such as methane would result in a sustained decline in global temperature. A modified approach to the use of GWP 100 (that equates constant emissions of short-lived climate forcers with zero sustained emission of CO 2 ) results in global temperatures remaining approximately constant once net-zero CO 2 -equivalent emissions are achieved and maintained. Our paper provides policymakers with an overview of issues and choices that are important to determine which approach is most appropriate in the context of the Paris Agreement.

                "abstract": "We explore the feasibility of limiting global warming to 1.5°C without overshoot and without the deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies. For this purpose, we perform a sensitivity analysis of four generic emissions reduction measures to identify a lower bound on future CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes. Final energy demand reductions and electrification of energy end uses as well as decarbonization of electricity and non-electric energy supply are all considered. We find the lower bound of cumulative fossil fuel and industry CO2 emissions to be 570 GtCO2 for the period 2016-2100, around 250 GtCO2 lower than the lower end of available 1.5°C mitigation pathways generated with integrated assessment models. Estimates of 1.5°C-consistent CO2 budgets are highly uncertain and range between 100 and 900 GtCO2 from 2016 onwards. Based on our sensitivity analysis, limiting warming to 1.5°C will require CDR or terrestrial net carbon uptake if 1.5°C-consistent budgets are smaller than 650 GtCO2 The earlier CDR is deployed, the more it neutralizes post-2020 emissions rather than producing net negative emissions. Nevertheless, if the 1.5°C budget is smaller than 550 GtCO2, temporary overshoot of the 1.5°C limit becomes unavoidable if CDR cannot be ramped up faster than to 4 GtCO2 in 2040 and 10 GtCO2 in 2050.This article is part of the theme issue 'The Paris Agreement: understanding the physical and social challenges for a warming world of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels'.",

Countries put forward pledges called nationally determined contributions (NDC) whose impact is assessed in global stocktaking exercises. Subsequently, actions can then be strengthened in light of the Paris climate objective: limiting global mean temperature increase to well below 2 °C and pursuing efforts to limit it further to 1.5 °C. However, pledged actions are currently described ambiguously and this complicates the global stocktaking exercise. Here, we systematically explore possible interpretations of NDC assumptions, and show that this results in estimated emissions for 2030 ranging from 47 to 63 GtCO 2 e yr −1 . We show that this uncertainty has critical implications for the feasibility and cost to limit warming well below 2 °C and further to 1.5 °C. Countries are currently working towards clarifying the modalities of future NDCs. We identify salient avenues to reduce the overall uncertainty by about 10 percentage points through simple, technical clarifications regarding energy accounting rules. Remaining uncertainties depend to a large extent on politically valid choices about how NDCs are expressed, and therefore raise the importance of a thorough and robust process that keeps track of where emissions are heading over time.",

                "abstract": "Abstract For aiming to keep global warming well-below 2 °C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 °C, as set out in the Paris Agreement, a full-fledged assessment of negative emission technologies (NETs) that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is crucial to inform science-based policy making. With the Paris Agreement in mind, we re-analyse available scenario evidence to understand the roles of NETs in 1.5 °C and 2 °C scenarios and, for the first time, link this to a systematic review of findings in the underlying literature. In line with previous research, we find that keeping warming below 1.5 °C requires a rapid large-scale deployment of NETs, while for 2 °C, we can still limit NET deployment substantially by ratcheting up near-term mitigation ambition. Most recent evidence stresses the importance of future socio-economic conditions in determining the flexibility of NET deployment and suggests opportunities for hedging technology risks by adopting portfolios of NETs. Importantly, our thematic review highlights that there is a much richer set of findings on NETs than commonly reflected upon both in scientific assessments and available reviews. In particular, beyond the common findings on NETs underpinned by dozens of studies around early scale-up, the changing shape of net emission pathways or greater flexibility in the timing of climate policies, there is a suite of “niche and emerging findings”, e.g. around innovation needs and rapid technological change, termination of NETs at the end of the twenty-first century or the impacts of climate change on the effectiveness of NETs that have not been widely appreciated. Future research needs to explore the role of climate damages on NET uptake, better understand the geophysical constraints of NET deployment (e.g. water, geological storage, climate feedbacks), and provide a more systematic assessment of NET portfolios in the context of sustainable development goals.",

Consequences of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on agricultural productivity have direct and immediate relevance for human societies. Future crop yields will be affected by anthropogenic climate change as well as direct effects of emissions such as CO2 fertilization. At the same time, the climate sensitivity to future emissions is uncertain. Here we investigate the sensitivity of future crop yield projections with a set of global gridded crop models for four major staple crops at 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming above pre-industrial levels, as well as at different CO2 levels determined by similar probabilities to lead to 1.5 °C and 2 °C, using climate forcing data from the Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts project. For the same CO2 forcing, we find consistent negative effects of half a degree warming on productivity in most world regions. Increasing CO2 concentrations consistent with these warming levels have potentially stronger but highly uncertain effects than 0.5 °C warming increments. Half a degree warming will also lead to more extreme low yields, in particular over tropical regions.

                "abstract": "This article investigates projected changes in temperature and water cycle extremes at 1.5°C of global warming, and highlights the role of land processes and land-use changes (LUCs) for these projections. We provide new comparisons of changes in climate at 1.5°C versus 2°C based on empirical sampling analyses of transient simulations versus simulations from the ‘Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts’ (HAPPI) multi-model experiment. The two approaches yield similar overall results regarding changes in climate extremes on land, and reveal a substantial difference in the occurrence of regional extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C. Land processes mediated through soil moisture feedbacks and land-use forcing play a major role for projected changes in extremes at 1.5°C in most mid-latitude regions, including densely populated areas in North America, Europe and Asia. This has important implications for low-emissions scenarios derived from integrated assessment models (IAMs), which include major LUCs in ambitious mitigation pathways (e.g. associated with increased bioenergy use), but are also shown to differ in the simulated LUC patterns. Biogeophysical effects from LUCs are not considered in the development of IAM scenarios, but play an important role for projected regional changes in climate extremes, and are thus of high relevance for sustainable development pathways. This article is part of the theme issue ‘The Paris Agreement: understanding the physical and social challenges for a warming world of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels'.",

                "abstract": "Abstract The 2015 Paris Agreement sets out that rapid reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are needed to keep global warming to safe levels. A new approach (known as GWP *) has been suggested to compare contributions of long- and short-lived GHGs, providing a close link between cumulative CO 2 -equivalent emissions and total warming. However, comparison factors for non-CO 2 GHGs under the GWP * metric depend on past emissions, and hence raise questions of equity and fairness when applied at any but the global level. The use of GWP * would put most developing countries at a disadvantage compared to developed countries, because when using GWP * countries with high historical emissions of short-lived GHGs are exempted from accounting for avoidable future warming that is caused by sustaining these emissions. We show that when various established equity or fairness criteria are applied to GWP * (defined here as eGWP *), perceived national non-CO 2 emissions vary by more than an order of magnitude, particularly in countries with high methane emissions like New Zealand. We show that national emission estimates that use GWP * are very sensitive to arbitrary choices made by countries and therewith facilitate the creation of loopholes when CO 2 -equivalent emissions based on the GWP * concept are traded between countries that use different approaches. In light of such equity-dependent accounting differences, GHG metrics like GWP * should only be used at the global level. A common, transparent and equity-neutral accounting metric is vital for the Paris Agreement’s effectiveness and its environmental integrity.",

We present the initial results from a coordinated Intercomparison, CovidMIP, of Earth system model simulations which assess the impact on climate of these emissions reductions. 12 models performed multiple initial‐condition ensembles to produce over 300 simulations spanning both initial condition and model structural uncertainty. We find model consensus on reduced aerosol amounts (particularly over southern and eastern Asia) and associated increases in surface shortwave radiation levels. However, any impact on near‐surface temperature or rainfall during 2020–2024 is extremely small and is not detectable in this initial analysis. Regional analyses on a finer scale, and closer attention to extremes (especially linked to changes in atmospheric composition and air quality) are required to test the impact of COVID‐19‐related emission reductions on near‐term climate.",

The expansive evidence warrants the use of machine learning to systematically select relevant research and provide an inventory of nearly 400 co-benefits, challenges, and limits. We find rich evidence in Europe but little information for Africa, South America, and Oceania, where large-scale carbon dioxide removal is nevertheless projected.

                "abstract": "Abstract. In every Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment cycle, a multitude of scenarios are assessed, with different scope and emphasis throughout the various Working Group reports and special reports, as well as their respective chapters. Within the reports, the ambition is to integrate knowledge on possible climate futures across the Working Groups and scientific research domains based on a small set of “framing pathways” such as the so-called representative concentration pathways (RCPs) in the Fifth IPCC Assessment Report (AR5) and the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). This perspective, initiated by discussions at the IPCC Bangkok workshop in April 2023 on the “Use of Scenarios in AR6 and Subsequent Assessments”, is intended to serve as one of the community contributions to highlight the needs for the next generation of framing pathways that is being advanced under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) umbrella, which will influence or even predicate the IPCC AR7 consideration of framing pathways. Here we suggest several policy research objectives that such a set of framing pathways should ideally fulfil, including mitigation needs for meeting the Paris Agreement objectives, the risks associated with carbon removal strategies, the consequences of delay in enacting that mitigation, guidance for adaptation needs, loss and damage, and for achieving mitigation in the wider context of societal development goals. Based on this context, we suggest that the next generation of climate scenarios for Earth system models should evolve towards representative emission pathways (REPs) and suggest key categories for such pathways. These framing pathways should address the most critical mitigation policy and adaptation plans that need to be implemented over the next 10 years. In our view, the most important categories are those relevant in the context of the Paris Agreement long-term goal, specifically an immediate action (low overshoot) 1.5 °C pathway and a delayed action (high overshoot) 1.5 °C pathway. Two other key categories are a pathway category approximately in line with current (as expressed by 2023) near- and long-term policy objectives, as well as a higher-emission category that is approximately in line with “current policies” (as expressed by 2023). We also argue for the scientific and policy relevance in exploring two “worlds that could have been”. One of these categories has high-emission trajectories well above what is implied by current policies and the other has very-low-emission trajectories which assume that global mitigation action in line with limiting warming to 1.5 °C without overshoot had begun in 2015. Finally, we note that the timely provision of new scientific information on pathways is critical to inform the development and implementation of climate policy. Under the Paris Agreement, for the second global stocktake, which will occur in 2028, and to inform subsequent development of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) up to 2040, scientific inputs are required by 2027. These needs should be carefully considered in the development timeline of community modelling activities, including those under CMIP7.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Under current emission trajectories, temporarily overshooting the Paris global warming limit of 1.5 °C is a distinct possibility. Permanently exceeding this limit would substantially increase the probability of triggering climate tipping elements. Here, we investigate the tipping risks associated with several policy-relevant future emission scenarios, using a stylised Earth system model of four interconnected climate tipping elements. We show that following current policies this century would commit to a 45% tipping risk by 2300 (median, 10–90% range: 23–71%), even if temperatures are brought back to below 1.5 °C. We find that tipping risk by 2300 increases with every additional 0.1 °C of overshoot above 1.5 °C and strongly accelerates for peak warming above 2.0 °C. Achieving and maintaining at least net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2100 is paramount to minimise tipping risk in the long term. Our results underscore that stringent emission reductions in the current decade are critical for planetary stability.",

                "abstract": "Limiting global warming to any level requires limiting the total amount of CO2 emissions, or staying within a CO2 budget. Here we assess how emissions from short-lived non-CO2 species like methane, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), black-carbon, and sulphates influence these CO2 budgets. Our default case, which assumes mitigation in all sectors and of all gases, results in a CO2 budget between 2011–2100 of 340 PgC for a >66% chance of staying below 2°C, consistent with the assessment of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Extreme variations of air-pollutant emissions from black-carbon and sulphates influence this budget by about ±5%. In the hypothetical case of no methane or HFCs mitigation—which is unlikely when CO2 is stringently reduced—the budgets would be much smaller (40% or up to 60%, respectively). However, assuming very stringent CH4 mitigation as a sensitivity case, CO2 budgets could be 25% higher. A limit on cumulative CO2 emissions remains critical for temperature targets. Even a 25% higher CO2 budget still means peaking global emissions in the next two decades, and achieving net zero CO2 emissions during the third quarter of the 21st century. The leverage we have to affect the CO2 budget by targeting non-CO2 diminishes strongly along with CO2 mitigation, because these are partly linked through economic and technological factors.",

However, achieving such rapid reductions may depend on early retirement of coal- and natural gas-fired power plants. Here, we analyze future fossil fuel electricity demand in 171 energy-emissions scenarios from Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), evaluating the implicit retirements and/or reduced operation of generating infrastructure. Although IAMs calculate retirements endogenously, the structure and methods of each model differ; we use a standard approach to infer retirements in outputs from all six major IAMs and—unlike the IAMs themselves—we begin with the age distribution and region-specific operating capacities of the existing power fleet. We find that coal-fired power plants in scenarios consistent with international climate targets (i.e. keeping global warming well-below 2 °C or 1.5 °C) retire one to three decades earlier than historically has been the case. If plants are built to meet projected fossil electricity demand and instead allowed to operate at the level and over the lifetimes they have historically, the roughly 200 Gt CO 2 of additional emissions this century would be incompatible with keeping global warming well-below 2 °C. Thus, ambitious climate mitigation scenarios entail drastic, and perhaps un-appreciated, changes in the operating and/or retirement schedules of power infrastructure.",

                "abstract": "In order to assess future sea level rise and its societal impacts, we need to study climate change pathways combined with different scenarios of socioeconomic development. Here, we present sea level rise (SLR) projections for the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) storylines and different year-2100 radiative forcing targets (FTs). Future SLR is estimated with a comprehensive SLR emulator that accounts for Antarctic rapid discharge from hydrofracturing and ice cliff instability. Across all baseline scenario realizations (no dedicated climate mitigation), we find 2100 median SLR relative to 1986–2005 of 89 cm (likely range: 57–130 cm) for SSP1, 105 cm (73–150 cm) for SSP2, 105 cm (75–147 cm) for SSP3, 93 cm (63–133 cm) for SSP4, and 132 cm (95–189 cm) for SSP5. The 2100 sea level responses for combined SSP-FT scenarios are dominated by the mitigation targets and yield median estimates of 52 cm (34–75 cm) for FT 2.6 Wm−2, 62 cm (40–96 cm) for FT 3.4 Wm−2, 75 cm (47–113 cm) for FT 4.5 Wm−2, and 91 cm (61–132 cm) for FT 6.0 Wm−2. Average 2081–2100 annual SLR rates are 5 mm yr−1 and 19 mm yr−1 for FT 2.6 Wm−2 and the baseline scenarios, respectively. Our model setup allows linking scenario-specific emission and socioeconomic indicators to projected SLR. We find that 2100 median SSP SLR projections could be limited to around 50 cm if 2050 cumulative CO2 emissions since pre-industrial stay below 850 GtC, with a global coal phase-out nearly completed by that time. For SSP mitigation scenarios, a 2050 carbon price of 100 US$2005 tCO2−1 would correspond to a median 2100 SLR of around 65 cm. Our results confirm that rapid and early emission reductions are essential for limiting 2100 SLR.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Emission pathways that are consistent with meeting the Paris Agreement goal of holding global mean temperature rise well below 2 °C often assume a temperature overshoot. In such overshoot scenarios, a given temperature limit is first exceeded and later returned to, under the assumption of large‐scale deliberate carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. Here we show that although such strategy might result in a reversal of global mean temperature, the carbon cycle exhibits path dependence. After an overshoot, more carbon is stored in the ocean and less on land compared to a scenario with the same cumulative CO 2 emissions but no overshoot. The near‐path independence of surface air temperature arises despite the path dependence in the carbon cycle, as it is offset by path dependence in the thermal response of the ocean. Such behavior has important implications for carbon budgets (i.e. the total amount of CO 2 emissions consistent with holding warming to a given level), which do not differ much among scenarios that entail different levels of overshoot. Therefore, the concept of a carbon budget remains robust for scenarios with low levels of overshoot (up to 300 Pg C overshoot considered here) but should be used with caution for higher levels of overshoot, particularly for limiting the environmental change in dimensions other than global mean temperature rise.",

                "abstract": "Abstract. Lockdowns to avoid the spread of COVID-19 have created an unprecedented reduction in human emissions. While the country-level scale of emissions changes can be estimated in near real time, the more detailed, gridded emissions estimates that are required to run general circulation models (GCMs) of the climate will take longer to collect. In this paper we use recorded and projected country-and-sector activity levels to modify gridded predictions from the MESSAGE-GLOBIOM SSP2-4.5 scenario. We provide updated projections for concentrations of greenhouse gases, emissions fields for aerosols, and precursors and the ozone and optical properties that result from this. The code base to perform similar modifications to other scenarios is also provided. We outline the means by which these results may be used in a model intercomparison project (CovidMIP) to investigate the impact of national lockdown measures on climate, including regional temperature, precipitation, and circulation changes. This includes three strands: an assessment of short-term effects (5-year period) and of longer-term effects (30 years) and an investigation into the separate effects of changes in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. This last strand supports the possible attribution of observed changes in the climate system; hence these simulations will also form part of the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP).",

New research has improved our understanding about the remaining options to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, through overcoming political barriers to carbon pricing, taking into account non-CO 2 factors, a well-designed implementation of demand-side and nature-based solutions, resilience building of ecosystems and the recognition that climate change mitigation costs can be justified by benefits to the health of humans and nature alone. We consider new insights about what to expect if we fail to include a new dimension of fire extremes and the prospect of cascading climate tipping elements. Technical summary A synthesis is made of 10 topics within climate research, where there have been significant advances since January 2020. The insights are based on input from an international open call with broad disciplinary scope. Findings include: (1) the options to still keep global warming below 1.5 °C; (2) the impact of non-CO 2 factors in global warming; (3) a new dimension of fire extremes forced by climate change; (4) the increasing pressure on interconnected climate tipping elements; (5) the dimensions of climate justice; (6) political challenges impeding the effectiveness of carbon pricing; (7) demand-side solutions as vehicles of climate mitigation; (8) the potentials and caveats of nature-based solutions; (9) how building resilience of marine ecosystems is possible; and (10) that the costs of climate change mitigation policies can be more than justified by the benefits to the health of humans and nature.

However, the amount of CDR varies considerably among scenarios. We analyze the range in CDR volumes in AR6 WGIII pathways by exploring relationships between variables as potential driving forces, focusing on CDR in 2050 and scenario properties linked to reaching net-zero CO 2 . It is also shown how the relative and absolute contribution of CDR to total mitigation up until reaching net-zero CO 2 substantially differs across scenarios. The volumes of CDR in 2050 and 2100 and the cumulative amount throughout the 21 st century were most strongly correlated to the degree to which CO 2 emissions are reduced as a means of reaching net-zero CO 2 . CDR in 2050 is also substantially correlated to the timing of net-zero CO 2 . The robustness of the analyzed relationships was evaluated by comparing different scenario filtering and data-cleaning approaches. Beyond filtering and cleaning, additional factors that influence CDR deployment in scenarios, such as discount rates, carbon price trajectories, and scenario design choices, were discussed.",

Studies of these distributional labour impacts could benefit from tighter linkages between energy and employment modelling. Here, we couple a power-sector optimization model, an employment impact model and demographic databases to understand state-level job characteristics and the societal implications of low-carbon transitions in the US. Although decarbonization brings consistent job growth, it heightens the need for investment in human capital and supply chain restructuring. Major fossil fuel-producing states need to prepare for fewer mining jobs under the US Long-Term Strategy, so other opportunities should be created or seized. The lowest-skilled workers will experience more uncertain employment outcomes. Expanding renewable energy could improve opportunities for women in fossil fuel-dependent states, but not enough to disrupt the national gender status quo. This work provides a new quantitative perspective to inform proactive just transition policies.",

Here, using MESSAGEix-Australia, we create 51 emissions scenarios for Australia with near-term GDP growth going from +3%/year to rapid reductions (−5%/year) to explore how a traditional integrated assessment model (IAM) represents degrowth from an economic starting point, not just energy demand reduction. We find that stagnating GDP per capita reduces the mid-century need for upscaling solar and wind energy by about 40% compared to the SSP2 growth baseline, and limits future material needs for renewables. Still, solar and wind energy in 2030 is more than quadruple that of 2020. Faster reductions in energy demand may entail higher socio-cultural feasibility concerns, depending on the policies involved. Strong reductions in inequality reduce the risk of lowered access to decent living services. We discuss research needs and possible IAM extensions to improve post-growth and degrowth scenario modelling.",

Estimates based on the observed warming trends favor lower values, while the skill with which comprehensive climate models are able to simulate present day climate implies higher values to be more plausible. We find that much lower values would postpone crossing the 2 °C temperature threshold by about a decade for emissions near current levels, or alternatively would imply that limiting warming to below 1.5 °C would require about the same emission reductions as are now assumed for 2 °C. It is just as plausible, however, for climate sensitivity to be at the upper end of the consensus range. To stabilize global-mean temperature at levels of 2 °C or lower, strong reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in order to stay within the allowed carbon budget seem therefore unavoidable over the 21st century. Early reductions and the required phase-out of unabated fossil fuel emissions would be an important societal challenge. However, erring on the side of caution reduces the risk that future generations will face either the need for even larger emission reductions or very high climate change impacts.",

This can increase food prices, and hence raises food security concerns. Here we show how an inclusive policy design can avoid these adverse side-effects. Food-security support through international aid, bioenergy tax, or domestic reallocation of income can shield impoverished and vulnerable people from the additional risk of hunger that would be caused by the economic effects of policies narrowly focussing on climate objectives only. In the absence of such support, 35% more people might be at risk of hunger by 2050 (i.e. 84 million additional people) in a 2 °C-consistent scenario. The additional global welfare changes due to inclusive climate policies are small (<0.1%) compared to the total climate mitigation cost (3.7% welfare loss), and the financial costs of international aid amount to about half a percent of high-income countries' GDP. This implies that climate policy should treat this issue carefully. Although there are challenges to implement food policies, options exist to avoid the food security concerns often linked to climate mitigation.",

The output of this process is a scenario framework exploring where the region is headed rather than how to achieve its goals, extrapolating its current policy efforts into the future. We find that Europe is currently on track to overperforming its pre-2020 40% target yet far from its newest ambition of 55% emissions cuts by 2030, as well as looking at a 1.0–2.35 GtCO2 emissions range in 2050. Aside from the importance of transport electrification, deployment levels of carbon capture and storage are found intertwined with deeper emissions cuts and with hydrogen diffusion, with most hydrogen produced post-2040 being blue.

                "abstract": "Abstract. While the IPCC’s physical science report usually assesses a handful of future scenarios, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Working Group III report (AR6 WGIII) on climate mitigation assesses hundreds to thousands of future emissions scenarios. A key task is to assess the global-mean temperature outcomes of these scenarios in a consistent manner, given the challenge that the emission scenarios from different integrated assessment models come with different sectoral and gas-to-gas coverage and cannot all be assessed consistently by complex Earth System Models. In this work, we describe the “climate assessment” workflow and its methods, including infilling of missing emissions and emissions harmonisation as applied to 1,202 mitigation scenarios in AR6 WGIII. We evaluate the global-mean temperature projections and effective radiative forcing characteristics (ERF) of climate emulators FaIRv1.6.2, MAGICCv7.5.3, and CICERO-SCM, discuss overshoot severity of the mitigation pathways using overshoot degree years, and look at an interpretation of compatibility with the Paris Agreement. We find that the lowest class of emission scenarios that limit global warming to “1.5 °C (with a probability of greater than 50 %) with no or limited overshoot” includes 90 scenarios for MAGICCv7.5.3, and 196 for FaIRv1.6.2. For the MAGICCv7.5.3 results, “limited overshoot” typically implies exceedance of median temperature projections of up to about 0.1 °C for up to a few decades, before returning to below 1.5 °C by or before the year 2100. For more than half of the scenarios of this category that comply with three criteria for being “Paris-compatible”, including net-zero or net-negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, are projected to see median temperatures decline by about 0.3–0.4 °C after peaking at 1.5–1.6 °C in 2035–2055. We compare the methods applied in AR6 with the methods used for SR1.5 and discuss the implications. This article also introduces a ‘climate-assessment’ Python package which allows for fully reproducing the IPCC AR6 WGIII temperature assessment. This work can be the start of a community tool for assessing the temperature outcomes related to emissions pathways, and potential further work extending the workflow from emissions to global climate by downscaling climate characteristics to a regional level and calculating impacts.",

Here we evaluate recent RCB assessments by the IPCC and explain differences between them. We present calculation refinements together with robustness checks that increase confidence in RCB estimates. We conclude that the RCB for a 50% chance of keeping warming to 1.5C is around 250 GtCO2 as of January 2023, around 6 years of current CO2 emissions. This estimate changes to 480 and 60 GtCO2 for a 33% and 66% chance, respectively. Key uncertainties affecting RCB estimates are the contribution of non-CO2 emissions, which depends on socioeconomic projections as much as on geophysical uncertainty, and potential warming after net zero is reached.&amp;#160;",

However, limitations in the provision of actionable climate information may hinder an adequate response. Here we suggest a reversal of the traditional impact chain methodology as an end-user focused approach to link local climate risks to emission pathways. We outline the socio-economic and value judgment dimensions that can inform identification of such local risk thresholds and adaptation limits. We apply this approach to heat-mortality risks for the city of Berlin. To limit the likely maximum increase in the occurrence of heat days with expected health impacts to less than 50% compared to today, the remaining global carbon budget in 2020 is 700 Gt CO2. We argue that linking local risk threshold exceedance directly to global emission benchmarks can aid the understanding of the benefits of stringent emission reductions for societies and local decision-makers.",

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments are the trusted source of scientific evidence for climate negotiations taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system. However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5–10 years, creating potential for an information gap between report cycles. We follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, the Earth's energy imbalance, surface temperature changes, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of this effort, grounded in an open data, open science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11064126, Smith et al., 2024a). As they are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel. The indicators show that, for the 2014–2023 decade average, observed warming was 1.19 [1.06 to 1.30] °C, of which 1.19 [1.0 to 1.4] °C was human-induced. For the single year average, human-induced warming reached 1.31 [1.1 to 1.7] °C in 2023 relative to 1850–1900. This is below the 2023 observed record of 1.43 [1.32 to 1.53] °C, indicating a substantial contribution of internal variability in the 2023 record. Human-induced warming has been increasing at rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record, reaching 0.26 [0.2–0.4] °C per decade over 2014–2023. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of greenhouse gas emissions being at an all-time high of 54 ± 5.4 GtCO2e per year over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for some of the indicators presented here.",

The feasibility of limiting warming to 1.5 °C is therefore questioned. Here we present a model intercomparison study that accounts for emissions trends until 2023 and compares cost-effective scenarios to alternative scenarios with institutional, geophysical and technological feasibility constraints and enablers informed by previous literature. Our results show that the most ambitious mitigation trajectories with updated climate information still manage to limit peak warming to below 1.6 °C (‘low overshoot’) with around 50% likelihood. However, feasibility constraints, especially in the institutional dimension, decrease this maximum likelihood considerably to 5–45%. Accelerated energy demand transformation can reduce costs for staying below 2 °C but have only a limited impact on further increasing the likelihood of limiting warming to 1.6 °C. Our study helps to establish a new benchmark of mitigation scenarios that goes beyond the dominant cost-effective scenario design.",

Here we report the results of a survey of 211 IPCC authors about the likelihood of four key climate outcomes. We found that most authors are skeptical that warming will be limited to the Paris targets of well below 2 °C, but are more optimistic that net zero CO 2 emissions will be reached during the second half of this century. When asked about the beliefs of their peers, author responses showed strong correlations between personal and peer beliefs, suggesting that participants with extreme beliefs perceive their own estimates as closer to the community average than they actually are.",

Previous phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) have primarily focused on simulations driven by atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs), for both idealized model experiments and climate projections of different emissions scenarios.

Mitigation policy is defined in terms of human activity (including emissions), with strategies varying in their timing of net-zero emissions, the balance of mitigation effort between short-lived and long-lived climate forcers, their reliance on land use strategy, and the extent and timing of carbon removals. To explore the response to these drivers, ESMs need to explicitly represent complete cycles of major GHGs, including natural processes and anthropogenic influences. Carbon removal and sequestration strategies, which rely on proposed human management of natural systems, are currently calculated in integrated assessment models (IAMs) during scenario development with only the net carbon emissions passed to the ESM. However, proper accounting of the coupled system impacts of and feedback on such interventions requires explicit process representation in ESMs to build self-consistent physical representations of their potential effectiveness and risks under climate change. We propose that CMIP7 efforts prioritize simulations driven by CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use and projected deployment of carbon dioxide removal technologies, as well as land use and management, using the process resolution allowed by state-of-the-art ESMs to resolve carbon–climate feedbacks. Post-CMIP7 ambitions should aim to incorporate modeling of non-CO2 GHGs (in particular, sources and sinks of methane and nitrous oxide) and process-based representation of carbon removal options. These developments will allow three primary benefits: (1) resources to be allocated to policy-relevant climate projections and better real-time information related to the detectability and verification of emissions reductions and their relationship to expected near-term climate impacts, (2) scenario modeling of the range of possible future climate states including Earth system processes and feedbacks that are increasingly well-represented in ESMs, and (3) optimal utilization of the strengths of ESMs in the wider context of climate modeling infrastructure (which includes simple climate models, machine learning approaches and kilometer-scale climate models).",

These limits are informed by risk assessments which draw upon projections of climate impacts under various levels of warming.

Depending on the methodological approach, differences can be time-variant and up to 0.2 °C for a warming of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. This might lead to carbon budget overestimates of about 10 years of continued year-2015 emissions, and about a 10% increase in estimated 2100 sea-level rise.

However, the full list of climate-relevant emissions is lengthy and most IAMs do not model all of them. Here we present Silicone, an open-source Python package which infers anthropogenic emissions of unmodelled species based on other reported emissions projections. For example, it can infer nitrous oxide emissions in one scenario based on carbon dioxide emissions from that scenario plus the relationship between nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions found in other scenarios. Infilling broadens the range of IAMs available for exploring projections of future climate change, and hence Silicone forms part of the open-source pipeline for assessments of the climate implications of IAM scenarios, led by the Integrated Assessment Modelling Consortium (IAMC). This paper presents a variety of infilling options and outlines their suitability for different cases. We recommend certain infilling techniques as good defaults but emphasise that considering the specifics of the model being infilled will produce better results. We demonstrate the package's utility with three examples: infilling all required gases for a pathway with data for only one emission species, splitting up a Kyoto emissions total into separate gases, and complementing a set of idealised emissions curves to provide a complete, consistent emissions portfolio. The code and notebooks explaining details of the package and how to use it are available on GitHub (https://github.com/GranthamImperial/silicone, last access: 2 November 2020).

Metrics are used to aggregate and compare emissions of short- and long-lived GHGs and need to account for the difference in both magnitude and persistence of their climatic effects. Different metrics describe different approaches and perspectives, and hence yield different numerical estimates for aggregated GHG emissions. When interpreting GHG emission reduction targets, being mindful of the underlying metrical choices thus proves to be essential. Here we present the impact a recently proposed GHG metric related to the concept of CO 2 forcing-equivalent emissions (called GWP*) would have on the internal consistency and environmental integrity of the Paris Agreement. We show that interpreting the Paris Agreement goals in a metric like GWP* that is significantly different from the standard metric used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report can lead to profound inconsistencies in the mitigation architecture of the Agreement. It could even undermine the integrity of the Agreement’s mitigation target altogether by failing to deliver net-zero CO 2 emissions and therewith failing to ensure warming is halted. Our results indicate that great care needs to be taken when applying new concepts that appear scientifically favourable to a pre-existing climate policy context.",

We use econometric estimates of climate damages on GDP growth and explicitly model the uncertainty in the persistence time of damages. The Integrated Assessment Model we use includes the climate system and mitigation technology detail required to derive near-term policies. We find an optimal carbon price of $115 per tonne of CO2 in 2030. The long-term persistence of damages, while highly uncertain, is a main driver of the near-term carbon price. Accounting for damages on economic growth increases the gap between the currently pledged nationally determined contributions and the welfare-optimal 2030 emissions by two thirds, compared to pathways considering the 2 ∘C limit only.",

                "abstract": "Abstract. Robust appraisals of climate impacts at different levels of global-mean temperature increase are vital to guide assessments of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Currently, two such levels are discussed in the context of the international climate negotiations as long-term global temperature goals: a below 2 °C and a 1.5 °C limit in global-mean temperature rise above pre-industrial levels. Despite the prominence of these two temperature limits, a comprehensive assessment of the differences in climate impacts at these levels is still missing. Here we provide an assessment of key impacts of climate change at warming levels of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, including extreme weather events, water availability, agricultural yields, sea-level rise and risk of coral reef loss. Our results reveal substantial differences in impacts between 1.5 °C and 2 °C. For heat-related extremes, the additional 0.5 °C increase in global-mean temperature marks the difference between events at the upper limit of present-day natural variability and a new climate regime, particularly in tropical regions. Similarly, this warming difference is likely to be decisive for the future of tropical coral reefs. In a scenario with an end-of-century warming of 2 °C, virtually all tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperature induced bleaching from 2050 onwards. This fraction is reduced to about 90 % in 2050 and projected to decline to 70 % by 2100 for a 1.5 °C scenario. Analyses of precipitation-related impacts reveal distinct regional differences and several hot-spots of change emerge. Regional reduction in median water availability for the Mediterranean is found to nearly double from 9 to 17 % between 1.5 °C and 2 °C, and the projected lengthening of regional dry spells increases from 7 % longer to 11 %. Projections for agricultural yields differ between crop types as well as world regions. While some (in particular high-latitude) regions may benefit, tropical regions like West Africa, South-East Asia, as well as Central and Northern South America are projected to face local yield reductions, particularly for wheat and maize. Best estimate sea-level rise projections based on two illustrative scenarios indicate a 50 cm rise by 2100 relative to year 2000-levels under a 2 °C warming, which is about 10 cm lower for a 1.5 °C scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of regional differentiation to assess future climate risks as well as different vulnerabilities to incremental increases in global-mean temperature. The article provides a consistent and comprehensive assessment of existing projections and a solid foundation for future work on refining our understanding of warming-level dependent climate impacts.",

Updates to this assessment, such as between the IPCC's Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) of warming and the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), are the result of intertwined, sometimes opaque, factors. Here we isolate one factor: the Earth System Model emulators used to estimate the global warming implications of scenarios. We show that warming projections using AR6-calibrated emulators are consistent, to within around 0.1°C, with projections made by the emulators used in SR1.5. The consistency is due to two almost compensating changes: the increase in assessed historical warming between SR1.5 (based on AR5) and AR6, and a reduction in projected warming due to improved agreement between the emulators' response to emissions and the assessment to which it is calibrated.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Tracking progress towards the Paris Agreement climate goal requires understanding the 2030 emission levels implied by countries’ National Determined Contributions (NDCs). However, key uncertainties and assumptions impact greenhouse gas (GHG) emission projections implied by the NDCs. This study analyses this impact, both globally and for major emitting countries. We find that the assessed uncertainties markedly affect global GHG emission projections. Full achievement of NDC targets is estimated to result in a range of 46–60 GtCO 2 eq by 2030 (median estimate: 53 GtCO 2 eq). The uncertainty in measuring historical emissions, including land-use, as reflected by different datasets is the most important contributing factor. This is followed by two equally important factors globally: socio-economic baseline uncertainty and uncertainty about the emissions implied by current policies in case NDCs are less ambitious than these. Overall, the impact of policy uncertainty (i.e. uncertainty resulting from conditionality of or ranges in NDC targets and uncertainty in emissions resulting from current policies) is about equally important as model/technical uncertainty (i.e. uncertainty in historical emissions and socio-economic baseline variations). This new insight is important for decision makers and researchers because a larger share of the total uncertainty is now attributable to aspects that can be influenced by policy decisions compared to previous analyses of NDC uncertainty.",

                "abstract": "Global-mean temperature increase is roughly proportional to cumulative emissions of carbon-dioxide (CO2). Limiting global warming to any level thus implies a finite CO2 budget. Due to geophysical uncertainties, the size of such budgets can only be expressed in probabilistic terms and is further influenced by non-CO2 emissions. We here explore how societal choices related to energy demand and specific mitigation options influence the size of carbon budgets for meeting a given temperature objective. We find that choices that exclude specific CO2 mitigation technologies (like Carbon Capture and Storage) result in greater costs, smaller compatible CO2 budgets until 2050, but larger CO2 budgets until 2100. Vice versa, choices that lead to a larger CO2 mitigation potential result in CO2 budgets until 2100 that are smaller but can be met at lower costs. In most cases, these budget variations can be explained by the amount of non-CO2 mitigation that is carried out in conjunction with CO2, and associated global carbon prices that also drive mitigation of non-CO2 gases. Budget variations are of the order of 10% around their central value. In all cases, limiting warming to below 2 °C thus still implies that CO2 emissions need to be reduced rapidly in the coming decades.",

                "abstract": "Abstract The relatively short atmospheric lifetimes of methane (CH 4 ) and black carbon (BC) have focused attention on the potential for reducing anthropogenic climate change by reducing Short-Lived Climate Forcer (SLCF) emissions. This paper examines radiative forcing and global mean temperature results from the Energy Modeling Forum (EMF)-30 multi-model suite of scenarios addressing CH 4 and BC mitigation, the two major short-lived climate forcers. Central estimates of temperature reductions in 2040 from an idealized scenario focused on reductions in methane and black carbon emissions ranged from 0.18–0.26 °C across the nine participating models. Reductions in methane emissions drive 60% or more of these temperature reductions by 2040, although the methane impact also depends on auxiliary reductions that depend on the economic structure of the model. Climate model parameter uncertainty has a large impact on results, with SLCF reductions resulting in as much as 0.3–0.7 °C by 2040. We find that the substantial overlap between a SLCF-focused policy and a stringent and comprehensive climate policy that reduces greenhouse gas emissions means that additional SLCF emission reductions result in, at most, a small additional benefit of ~ 0.1 °C in the 2030–2040 time frame.",

We use an integrated assessment model to explore potential pathway adjustments starting in 2025 and 2030, following the arrival of new information. The 1.5 °C target remains achievable in the model, in light of some adverse information, provided a broad portfolio of technologies and measures is still available. If multiple pieces of adverse information arrive simultaneously, average annual emissions reductions near 3 GtCO2/yr for the first five years following the pathway adjustment, compared to 2 GtCO2/yr in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic began. Moreover, in these scenarios of multiple simultaneous adverse information, by 2050 mitigation costs are 4-5 times as high as a no adverse information scenario, highlighting the criticality of developing a wide range of mitigation options, including energy demand reduction options.",

Large differences are found in the results of individual groups owing to uncertainties in current and projected emission estimates and in the interpretation of the reduction proposals. Regardless of these uncertainties, the pledges for 2020 are expected to deliver emission levels above those that are consistent with a 2°C limit. This emissions gap could be narrowed through implementing the more stringent conditional pledges, minimizing the use of 'lenient' credits from forests and surplus emission units, avoiding double-counting of offsets and implementing measures beyond current pledges. Conversely, emission reduction gains from countries moving from their low to high ambition pledges could be more than offset by the use of 'lenient' land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) credits and surplus emissions units, if these were used to the maximum. Laying the groundwork for faster emission reduction rates after 2020 appears to be crucial in any case.",

We find that historical emission levels aggregated from data that are officially reported by countries to the UNFCCC are lower than independent global emission estimates, such as the IPCC SRES scenarios. This discrepancy in historical emissions could substantially widen the gap between 2020 pledges and 2020 benchmarks, as the latter tend to be derived from scenarios that share similar historical emission levels to IPCC SRES scenarios. Three methods for resolving this discrepancy, here called 'harmonization', are presented and their influence on 'gap' estimates is discussed. Instead of a 3.4–9.2 GtCO2eq shortfall in emission reductions by 2020 compared with the 44 GtCO2eq benchmark, the actual gap might be as high as 5.4–12.5 GtCO2eq (a 22–88% increase of the gap) if this historical discrepancy is accounted for. Not applying this harmonization step when using 2020 emission benchmarks could lead to an underestimation of the insufficiency of current mitigation pledges.",

It finds many significant climate and development impacts are already being felt in some regions, and in some cases multiple threats of increasing extreme heat waves, sea level rise, more severe storms, droughts and floods are expected to have further severe negative implications for the poorest. Climate related extreme events could push households below the poverty trap threshold. High temperature extremes appear likely to affect yields of rice, wheat, maize and other important crops, adversely affecting food security. Promoting economic growth and the eradication of poverty and inequality will thus be an increasingly challenging task under future climate change. Immediate steps are needed to help countries adapt to the risks already locked in at current levels of 0.8°C warming, but with ambitious global action to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, many of the worst projected climate impacts could still be avoided by holding warming below 2°C.",

The model explains outbreak cycles both for geometrid moths and bark beetles, and provides insight into the relative importance and interactions between the multi-scale drivers of outbreak dynamics. Our results demonstrate that outbreak behavior is most sensitive to changes in pest pressure at the local scale, and that accounting for the spatial connectivity of habitat patches is crucial to capturing the spreading behavior through landscapes. In contrast to early warning signals based on retrospective data, our model provides predictions of future outbreak risk based on a mechanistic understanding of the system, which we apply for landscape-scale forest management.",

Yet the supply of high-quality NCS projects does not meet market demand, and projects already underway often fail to deliver their promised benefits, due to a complex set of interacting ecological, social, and financial constraints.

                "abstract": "Abstract. In every IPCC Assessment cycle, a multitude of scenarios are assessed, with different scope and emphasis throughout the various Working Group and Special Reports and their respective chapters. Within the reports, the ambition is to integrate knowledge on possible climate futures across the Working Groups and scientific research domains based on a small set of ‘framing pathways’, such as the so-called RCP pathways from the Fifth IPCC Assessment report (AR5) and the SSP-RCP scenarios in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). This perspective, initiated by discussions at the IPCC Bangkok workshop in April 2023 on the “Use of Scenarios in AR6 and Subsequent Assessments”, is intended to serve as one of the community contributions to highlight needs for the next generation of framing pathways that is being advanced under the CMIP umbrella for use in the IPCC AR7. Here we suggest a number of policy research objectives that such a set of framing pathways should ideally fulfil, including mitigation needs for meeting the Paris Agreement objectives, the risks associated with carbon removal strategies, the consequences of delay in enacting that mitigation, guidance for adaptation needs, loss and damage, and for achieving mitigation in the wider context of Societal Development goals. Based on this context we suggest that the next generation of climate scenarios for Earth System Models should evolve towards ‘Representative Emission Pathways’ (REPs) and suggest key categories for such pathways. These ‘framing pathways’ should address the most critical mitigation policy and adaptation needs over the next 5–10 years. In our view the most important categories are those relevant in the context of the Paris Agreement long-term goal, specifically an immediate action (low overshoot) 1.5 °C pathway, and a delayed action (high overshoot) 1.5 °C pathway. Two other key categories are a pathway category approximately in line with current (as expressed by 2023) near- and long-term policy objectives, and a higher emissions category that is approximately in line with “current policies” (as expressed by 2023). We also argue for the scientific and policy relevance in exploring two ‘worlds that could have been’. One of these categories has high emission trajectories well above what is implied by current policies, and the other has very low emission trajectories that assume that global mitigation action in line with limiting warming to 1.5 °C without overshoot had begun in 2015. Finally, we note that timely provision of new scientific information on pathways is critical to inform the development and implementation of climate policy. For the second Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement in 2028, and to inform subsequent development of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) up to 2040, scientific inputs are required well before 2028. These needs should be carefully considered in the development timeline of community modelling activities including those under CMIP7.",

                "abstract": "Global emission reduction efforts continue to be insufficient to meet the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. This makes the systematic exploration of so-called overshoot pathways that draw temperatures back down to safer levels in the long term a priority for science and policy. Here we show that global and regional climate change in a post-overshoot world would be substantially different from a world that avoided overshoot, bearing profound implications for adaptation needs. Irrespective of the peak warming, we find that achieving declining global temperature remains critical for limiting long-term climate risks including sea-level rise and cryosphere changes. Reversal of warming by deploying carbon dioxide removal (CDR) at scale, however, is not guaranteed. In addition to uncertain technical and sustainability limitations of CDR, we find that a preventive CDR capacity of several hundred gigatonnes might be desirable to hedge against strong Earth system feedbacks that amplify warming. Aiming for temperature decline is thus not a robust strategy to achieve a climate objective, but rather one part of a broader approach towards managing long-term climate risks. It is no replacement for stringent near-term emission reductions to limit risks at peak warming in the first place.",

                "abstract": "Abstract The era of anthropogenic climate change can be described by defined climate milestones. These milestones mark changes in the historic trajectory of change, and include peak greenhouse gas emissions, peak greenhouse gas concentration, deceleration of warming, net-zero emissions, and a transition to global cooling. However, given internal variability in the Earth system and measurement uncertainty, definitively saying that a milestone has passed requires rigour. Here CMIP6 simulations of peak-and-decline scenarios are used to examine the time needed to robustly detect three climate milestones: (1) the slowdown of global warming; (2) the end of global surface temperature increase; and (3) peak concentration of CO 2 . It is estimated that it will take 40 to 60 years after a simulated slowdown in warming rate, to robustly detect ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo> <mml:mstyle scriptlevel=\"0\"/> <mml:mn>95</mml:mn> <mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">%</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> change) the signal in the global average temperature record. Detecting when warming has stopped will also be difficult and it takes until the mid 22nd century to have enough data to conclude warming has stopped. Detecting that CO 2 concentration has peaked is far easier and a drop in CO 2 concentration of 3 ppm is consistent with a greater than 99% chance that CO 2 has peaked in all scenarios examined. Thus it is likely that as the rate of CO 2 emissions is reduced, and net-zero emissions is approached, interpreting the global temperature record will become difficult—with a high potential to create confusion amongst policy makers and the general public.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Due to insufficient climate action over the past decade, it is increasingly likely that 1.5 °C of global warming will be exceeded – at least temporarily – in the 21 st century. Such a temporary temperature overshoot carries additional climate risks which are poorly understood. Earth System Model climate projections are only available for a very limited number of overshoot pathways, thereby preventing comprehensive analysis of their impacts. Here, we address this issue by presenting a novel dataset of spatially resolved emulated annual temperature projections for different overshoot pathways. The dataset was created using the FaIR and MESMER emulators. First, FaIR was employed to translate ten different emission scenarios, including seven that are characterised by overshoot, into a large ensemble of forced global mean temperatures. These global mean temperatures were then converted into stochastic ensembles of local annual temperature fields using MESMER. To ensure an optimal tradeoff between accurate characterization of the ensemble spread and storage requirements for large ensembles, this procedure was accompanied by testing the sensitivity of sample quantiles to different ensemble sizes. The resulting dataset offers the unique opportunity to study local and regional climate change impacts of a range of overshoot scenarios, including the timing and magnitude of temperature thresholds exceedance.",

                "abstract": "Remaining carbon budget specifies the cap on global cumulative CO2 emissions from the present-day onwards that would be in line with limiting global warming to a specific maximum level. In the context of the Paris Agreement, global warming is usually interpreted as the externally-forced response to anthropogenic activities and emissions, but it excludes the natural fluctuations of the climate system known as internal variability. A remaining carbon budget can be calculated from an estimate of the anthropogenic warming to date, and either (i) the ratio of CO2-induced warming to cumulative emissions, known as the Transient Climate Response to Emissions (TCRE), in addition to information on the temperature response to the future evolution of non-CO2 emissions; or (ii) climate model scenario simulations that reach a given temperature threshold. Here we quantify the impact of internal variability on the carbon budgets consistent with the Paris Agreement derived using either approach, and on the TCRE diagnosed from individual models. Our results show that internal variability contributes approximately ±0.09 °C to the overall uncertainty range of the human-induced warming to-date, leading to a spread in the remaining carbon budgets as large as ±50 PgC, when using approach (i). Differences in diagnosed TCRE due to internal variability in individual models can be as large as ±0.1 °C/1000 PgC (5%–95% range). Alternatively, spread in the remaining carbon budgets calculated from (ii) using future concentration-driven simulations of large ensembles of CMIP6 and CMIP5 models is estimated at ±30 PgC and ±40 PgC (5%–95% range). These results are important for model evaluation and imply that caution is needed when interpreting small remaining budgets in policy discussions. We do not question the validity of a carbon budget approach in determining mitigation requirements. However, due to intrinsic uncertainty arising from internal variability, it may only be possible to determine the exact year when a budget is exceeded in hindsight, highlighting the importance of a precautionary approach.",

                "abstract": "Abstract The discovery of a near-proportionality between cumulative anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and global warming since pre-industrial times is arguably the most important policy-relevant simplification of climate change science in the last 25 years. Unfortunately, the latest CMIP6 Earth System Models continue to diagnose a wide range of carbon budgets for each level of global warming. In this paper we present emergent constraints on the carbon budget as a function of global warming, which combine the available CMIP6 Earth System Model historical simulations and future projections with observational estimates of global warming and anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the present day. We derive estimates for cumulative carbon budgets for the Paris targets of 1.5oC and 2oC of global warming of 812 +/- 121 PgC and 1048 +/- 167 PgC, which are significantly larger than the ensemble mean values from the CMIP6 models of 727 +/- 181 PgC and 911 +/- 247 PgC. Our approach produces estimates of the remaining carbon budgets for 1.5oC and 2.0oC within the uncertainty bounds of values given in the IPCC WG1 6th Assessment report, without requiring individual assumptions about the likely range of a number of climate and carbon cycle sensitivity factors, or implicit assumptions about changes in non-CO2 forcing factors. We infer a reduced mean specific carbon budget in the future (473+/-80 PgC/oC beyond 1.2oC of global warming) compared to the past (553+/82 PgC/oC ), primarily due to the decline in cooling atmospheric aerosols. However, the linearity between future cumulative emissions and future global warming is found to be maintained at least until 4oC of global warming, and is consistent with an effective Transient Climate Response to Emissions (TCRE) of 2.1 oC per trillion tonnes of carbon (likely range of 1.8 to 2.6 oC/1000PgC), from now onwards.",

Companies report voluntarily to CDP, providing total emissions and breakdowns into categories. How reliable are these accounts? Here, we show that their reliability is likely very poor. A significant proportion of Oil & Gas companies' emission reports between 2010 and 2019 fail a 'simple summation' mathematical test that identifies if the breakdowns add up to the totals. Companies' reports reflect unbalanced internal bookkeeping in 38.9% of cases, which suggests worryingly low quality standards for data guiding the private sector's contribution to halting climate change.",

Such scenario are typically created with integrated assessment models that include a representation of the economy, and the energy, land-use, and industrial system. However, current climate change scenarios have a key weakness in that they typically focus on reaching specific climate goals in 2100 only. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This choice results in risky pathways that delay action and seemingly inevitably rely on large quantities of carbon-dioxide removal after mid-century. Here we propose a framework that more closely reflects the intentions of the UN Paris Agreement. It focusses on reaching a peak in global warming with either stabilisation or reversal thereafter. This approach provides a critical extension of the widely used Shared Socioecononomic Pathways (SSP) framework and reveals a more diverse picture: an inevitable transition period of aggressive near-term climate action to reach carbon neutrality can be followed by a variety of long-term states. It allows policymakers to explicitly consider near-term climate strategies in the context of intergenerational equity and long-term sustainability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

                "abstract": "Abstract. The Zero Emissions Commitment (ZEC) is the change in global mean temperature expected to occur following the cessation of net CO2 emissions, and as such is a critical parameter for calculating the remaining carbon budget. The Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP) was established to gain a better understanding of the potential magnitude and sign of ZEC, in addition to the processes that underlie this metric. Eighteen Earth system models of both full and intermediate complexity participated in ZECMIP. All models conducted an experiment where atmospheric CO2 concentration increases exponentially until 1000 PgC has been emitted. Thereafter emissions are set to zero and models are configured to allow free evolution of atmospheric CO2 concentration. Many models conducted additional second priority simulations with different cumulative emissions totals and an alternative idealized emissions pathway with a gradual transition to zero emissions. The inter-model range of ZEC 50 years after emissions cease for the 1000 PgC experiment is − 0.36 to 0.29 ºC with a model ensemble mean of −0.06 ºC, median of −0.05 ºC and standard deviation of 0.19 ºC. Models exhibit a wide variety of behaviours after emissions cease, with some models continuing to warm for decades to millennia and others cooling substantially. Analysis shows that both ocean carbon uptake and carbon uptake by the terrestrial biosphere are important for counteracting the warming effect from reduction in ocean heat uptake in the decades after emissions cease. Overall, the most likely value of ZEC on multi-decadal timescales is close to zero, consistent with previous model experiments.",

The current generation of scenarios, however, are criticized because they rely heavily on net negative CO2 emissions (NNCE) that result from allowing temperature limits to be temporarily exceeded. In this study we present a new set of emissions scenarios that exclude NNCE. We show that such scenarios require a more rapid near-term transformation with significant long-term gains for the economy (even without considering the benefits of avoided climate impacts). Scenarios that avoid temperature overshoot and NNCE are thus not only economically more attractive over the long term, they also involve lower climate risks. Our study further identifies possible alternative configurations of net-zero CO2 emissions systems and the distinct roles of different sectors and regions in order to balance emissions sources and sinks.",

The overall scope of this ambition is expressed in its long-term temperature goal in Article 2 as well as the ‘net zero’ mitigation goal in Article 4. To provide guidance to climate policy, the scientific community has explored the characteristics of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction pathways that can meet the Paris Agreement goals. However, when categorizing and presenting such pathways including in reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the focus has been put on the temperature outcome and not on the emission reduction criteria set out in Article 4.1. Here we propose a pathway classification approach that aims to comprehensively reflect all climate criteria set out in the Paris Agreement. We show how such an approach allows for an internally consistent interpretation of the Paris Agreement in terms of emission reduction pathways. For pathways that simultaneously are very likely to hold warming to below 2°C, pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C and achieve the provisions outlined in Article 4.1, we report 2030 global Kyoto-GHG emissions of between 20-26 Gt CO2eq (interquartile range), net zero CO2 emissions around 2050 and net zero GHG emissions around 2060. We further illustrate how prevalent pathway classifications focusing, for example, on the temperature outcome in 2100 result in additional criteria being applied that are not rooted in the Paris Agreement. We outline the consequences of such approaches including for the deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in such pathways. We find that across pathways classified as ‘no or low overshoot’ pathways in previous IPCC reports, such non-Paris related, additional criteria for end-of-century outcomes may lead to about 20% higher CDR deployment compared to purely achieving the Paris Agreement objectives in mitigation pathways.",

Here we evaluate recent RCB assessments by the IPCC and explain differences between them. We present calculation refinements together with robustness checks that increase confidence in RCB estimates. We conclude that the RCB for a 50% chance of keeping warming to 1.5C is around 300 GtCO2 as of January 2022, less than 8 years of current emissions. This estimate changes to 530 and 110 GtCO2 for a 33% and 66% chance, respectively. Key uncertainties affecting RCB estimates are the contribution of non-CO2 emissions, which depends on socioeconomic projections as much as on geophysical uncertainty, and the potential warming after net zero is reached.",

We show that warming projections using AR6-calibrated emulators are consistent, to within around 0.1C, with projections made by the emulators used in SR1.5.

The assessment considers new evidence of past, present and projected future climate change based on many independent scientific analyses from observations of the climate system, paleo-climate archives, theoretical studies of climate processes and simulations using climate models. During the process of scoping and approving the outline of its Fifth Assessment Report, the IPCC focussed on those aspects of the current understanding of the science of climate change that were judged to be most relevant to policy-makers. In this report, Working Group I has extended coverage of future climate change compared to earlier reports by assessing near-term projections and predictability as well as long-term projections and irreversibility in two separate chapters. Following the decisions made by the Panel during the scoping and outline approval, a set of new scenarios, the Representative Concentration Pathways, are used across all three Working Groups for projections of climate change over the 21. century. The coverage of regional information in the Working Group I report is expanded by specifically assessing climate phenomena such as monsoon systems and their relevance to future climate change in the regions. The Working Group I Report is an assessment, not a review or a text book of climate science, and is based on the published scientific and technical literature available up to 15 March 2013. Underlying all aspects of the report is a strong commitment to assessing the science comprehensively, without bias and in a way that is relevant to policy but not policy prescriptive. This report consists of a short Summary in French for Policy-makers followed by the full version of the report in English comprising a longer Technical Summary and fourteen thematic chapters plus annexes. An innovation in this Working Group I assessment is the Atlas of Global and Regional Climate Projections (Annex I) containing time series and maps of temperature and precipitation projections for 35 regions of the world, which enhances accessibility for stakeholders and users. The Summary for Policy-makers and Technical Summary of this report follow a parallel structure and each includes cross-references to the chapter and section where the material being summarised can be found in the underlying report. In this way, these summary components of the report provide a road-map to the contents of the entire report and a traceable account of every major finding.",

There is a large variety of IAMs and, together with variations in socioeconomic and technological assumptions, this variety results in important differences in model behavior.

This briefing aims at exploring and understanding the variation in these carbon price estimates for stringent climate change mitigation scenarios.\r\nThe focus of this exercise will be on scenarios that limit global mean temperature surface increase (henceforth, warming) to below 2°C relative to preindustrial levels with a greater than 66% probability.

Our central estimate suggests partial damages of approximately 20 trillion USD, with the companies&amp;#8217; financial gains surpassing this by 50%, totaling around 30 trillion USD. This indicates the potential of carbon majors to cover their attributed damages while maintaining significant profits. In our analysis, we also explore how varying approaches to assigning responsibility and handling uncertainties in climate damages can markedly influence these findings. Additionally, we explore the role of sovereign wealth funds in perpetuating fossil-fuel derived wealth and the ensuing liability questions.",

                "abstract": "The era of anthropogenic climate change can be described by defined climate milestones. These milestones mark changes in the historic trajectory of change, and include peak greenhouse gas emissions, peak CO2 concentration, deceleration of warming, net-zero emissions, and a transition to global cooling. However, given internal variability in the Earth system and measurement uncertainty, definitively saying that a milestone has passed requires rigour, with the statistical illusion of the 2010s global warming hiatus being a recent cautionary tale of the need for robust methods. Here we use CMIP6 simulations of peak-and-decline scenarios to examine the time needed to robustly detect three climate milestones: 1) the slowdown of global warming; 2) the end of global surface temperature increase; and 3) peak concentration of CO2. To detect these climate milestones we use a modified version of the Monte-Carlo based method of Rahmstorf et al. 2017, developed to test whether the global warming hiatus was an illusion. The method has been modified to account for auto-correlated noise characteristic of the climate system. We estimate that it will take 40 to 60 years after a simulated slowdown in warming rate, to robustly detect the signal in the global average temperature record. Detecting when warming has stopped will also be difficult and for the one peak-and-decline scenario that has model simulations extended to the year 2300, it takes until the mid 22nd century to have enough data to conclude that&amp;#160; warming has stopped. Detecting that CO2 concentration has peaked is far easier, and a drop in CO2 concentration of 3 ppm is consistent with a greater than 99% chance that CO2 has peaked in all scenarios examined.&amp;#160; Overall it is sobering that even under aggressive mitigation scenarios a conclusive end to global warming is at the very outer edge of the living future, with only a small number of the very youngest children alive today likely to witness detection of the end of global warming.",

                "abstract": "Background: Due to ongoing delays in deep global emission reductions, and as more and more countries set national net-zero CO2 targets, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is continuously gaining importance and attention. Virtually all Paris-aligned AR6 mitigation pathways imply gigatonne-scale CO2 removal even before mid-century, with further upscaling thereafter. Integrated assessment models, used to explore the solution space, currently primarily rely on removals via bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation, which require massive amounts of land to meet scenario-implied removal scales. This substantial land demand is expected to have severe consequences for biodiversity, which could limit the sustainable scaling potential of these CDR options. Meanwhile, depending on the mode of implementation, afforestation could theoretically benefit habitat conservation in some cases, easing the immense pressure on biodiversity due to ongoing global warming and deforestation. Objective: By combining spatially-resolved data on biodiversity refugia with spatial time series data from the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM) on bioenergy crop plantations and afforestation under different mitigation scenarios, we estimate and compare land use and warming-related pressure on remaining global biodiversity refugia. We compare different biodiversity recovery assumptions after peak warming, consider the land use pressure of ongoing deforestation, and explore additional warming-related refugia loss when excluding CDR from scenarios. Preliminary results: We show how scenarios with more ambitious temperature outcomes result in higher land use-related pressure on remaining biodiversity refugia areas as more land-intensive CDR is implied in such pathways. Meanwhile, more decisive climate action, including more CDR, substantially reduces the warming-related loss of remaining biodiversity refugia areas. The underlying biodiversity recovery assumptions strongly impact the degree of warming-related refugia loss with considerably less influence on land use-related implications. Generally, the perceived trends are stronger towards 2100 compared to mid-century.",

Permanently exceeding this limit would substantially increase the risks of triggering several climate tipping elements with associated high-end impacts on human societies and the Earth system. It is essential to assess this risk under emission pathways that temporarily overshoot 1.5 &amp;#176;C. Here, we investigate the tipping risks associated with a number of policy-relevant future emission scenarios, using a stylised Earth system model that comprises four interconnected core tipping elements. Assessing tipping risks in the year 2300, we find a non-linear increase for overshoots that exceed 1.8 &amp;#176;C peak temperature or persist above 1.5 &amp;#176;C beyond the end of the 21st century. Scenarios following current policies or pledges lead to high tipping risk of 30% (median) and more, with uncertainty from climate sensitivity and carbon-cycle feedbacks translating to large uncertainties in tipping risk (45% and more) for these scenarios. Further, we show that on multi-century timescales achieving and maintaining at least net-zero greenhouse gas emissions is paramount to minimise tipping risks. Our results underscore that stringent emission reductions in the current decade in line with the Paris Agreement 1.5 &amp;#176;C limit are critical for planetary stability.",

As ESMs are improved, adding in new processes that weren't explicitly included before, so too can the simple climate models be refined to reflect changes to our understanding of the climate response to changing emissions. New developments in modelling of peatlands, wetlands, permafrost, and negative emissions scenarios have provided new data to test the simple models MAGICC and FAIR. By comparing their projections under the same scenarios used by more complex models, the reduced complexity models' limitations and uncertainties can be shown, and thus they can be improved to better capture the new knowledge. Here, we focus on peatlands, comparing the results of a new module in the model OSCAR with the current output from MAGICC and FAIR, quantifying the impact that explicit peatland processes have on global temperature. Negative emissions scenarios are also considered, all as part of a broader project to understand overshoot pathways, scenarios in which the global temperature anomaly exceeds 1.5&amp;#176;C but returns to a temperature below that mark.

In its current version, several scenarios in the database lack information about the level of gross carbon removal on land, as net and gross removals on land are not always separated and consistently reported across models. This makes scenario analyses focusing on carbon removals challenging. We test and compare the performance of different regression models to impute missing data on land carbon sequestration from available data on net CO2 emissions in agriculture, forestry, and other land use. We find that a gradient boosting regression performs best among the tested regression models and provide a publicly available imputation dataset [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10696654] (Prütz et al., 2024) on carbon removal on land for 404 incomplete scenarios in the AR6 Scenario Database.

While a rich literature informs these deliberations, there remains a gap in approaches that appropriately consider non-CO 2 emissions and their warming contributions. In this study, we define a global warming budget applicable to all anthropogenic greenhouse gases and allocate it to countries based on equity principles drawn from international environmental law. We find that by 2021 up to 85 countries, including all major developed countries, exhausted their budget compatible with keeping warming to 1.5°C under all allocation approaches considered in this study. A similar picture emerges for 2°C. A large group of countries will hence exceed their fair shares even if their updated pledges under the Paris Agreement represent the deepest possible reductions. Considerations of fairness should therefore start to include aspects beyond domestic emissions reductions only.",

We use participant nomination data to investigate how incumbent business interest groups access COPs and evaluate the relationships between side event organisers and speakers. Among energy side events, we identified growing interests in fossil fuels, marked by a uniquely collaborative organisation network of mainly NGOs.

In this article, we address the pressing need for practical guidance on navigating this landscape in assessing relative mitigation efforts. The Paris Agreement mandates that updates to Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) include clear and transparent considerations of fairness. This reflects a progression from previous submissions where such considerations were optional and inconsistently addressed. We propose a set of entry points for examining and revising these assertions in practice. We demonstrate the use of this approach through a case study focusing on the European Union. Our work emphasizes the importance of explicitly defining foundational principles, specifying allocation quantities, defining allocation approaches, and presenting selected indicators to operationalize ‘fair shares’ in mitigation efforts.

                "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal of limiting global warming well-below 2°C while pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C requires rapid and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and CO<sub>2</sub> to be withdrawn from the atmosphere and safely stored. However, pathways consistent with the Paris long-term temperature goal span a wide range of emission reductions in coming years: the IPCC indicates 34-60% cuts in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2030 relative to 2019. This range is a major source of policy uncertainty. A key determinant of the rate at which emissions must be reduced this decade is the extent to which CO<sub>2</sub> removal (CDR) is relied on to withdraw emissions from the atmosphere. Nearly a decade after the adoption of the Paris Agreement, we evaluate the dependence on CDR of 71 states, primarily in their near and long-term climate strategies submitted to the UNFCCC by May 2024, and the associated risks. Our analysis finds substantial ambiguities in how states plan to meet their climate targets. A feature of this ambiguity is that states expect to rely heavily on novel and conventional CDR options to meet their climate goals, and in some cases, rely on removals delivered in other states’ territories. Pathways that overshoot 1.5°C and use CDR to remove emissions produced in excess of the 1.5°C-aligned carbon budget will result in more severe climate change impacts and higher risks of crossing planetary tipping points. Moreover, states’ disclosed reliance on CDR is highly exposed to risks to its delivery, and non-delivery of planned CDR would raise global temperatures further, worsening impacts of climate change. Our findings provide a basis for enhanced scrutiny of states’ targets. The risks associated with heavy reliance on CDR to meet climate goals indicate that states should prioritise pathways that minimise overshoot and the reliance on CDR to reach net-zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Fairness considerations have long been central to the international climate change mitigation discourse, generating numerous theoretical and philosophical debates. This article addresses the pressing need for practical guidance in developing assertions of fairness in national mitigation contributions. The Paris Agreement mandates that subsequent Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted under Article 4 represent a progression compared to previous NDCs. Further decisions under the Paris Agreement mandate that NDCs include clear and transparent considerations of fairness, as recalled in the first Global Stocktake. We propose a practical approach to approach this, comprising a set of ‘entry points’ that represent key stages where decisions are taken in ‘fair share’ quantifications, from interpreting foundational principles to selecting indicators and presenting results. By bridging the gap between scholarly debates and practical application, this study supports the integration of clear and transparent fairness considerations into climate policy commitments. We demonstrate the use of our approach through a case study.",

                "abstract": "Abstract. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) project future anthropogenic emissions for input into climate models. However, the full list of climate-relevant emissions is lengthy and most IAMs do not model all of them. Here we present silicone, an open-source Python package which infers anthropogenic emissions of missing species based on other known emissions. For example, it can infer nitrous oxide emissions in one scenario based on carbon dioxide emissions from that scenario plus the relationship between nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions in other scenarios. This broadens the range of IAMs available for exploring projections of future climate change. Silicone forms part of the open-source pipeline for assessments of the climate implications of IAMs by the IAM consortium (IAMC). A variety of infilling options are outlined and their suitability for different cases are discussed. The code and notebooks explaining details of the package and how to use it are available from the GitHub repository, https://github.com/GranthamImperial/silicone. There is an additional repository showing uses of the code to complement existing research at https://github.com/GranthamImperial/silicone_examples.",

We begin by reviewing some of the recent science in\r\nrelation to limiting warming to the agreed warming goals, and the relative role of different\r\ngreenhouse gases and other climate forcing agents. The scientific analysis in this paper is new in that\r\nit integrates insights from the recent reports published by the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme, relating to hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions, action on methane and action to reduce\r\nair pollution in the context of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to levels consistent with\r\nholding warming to below 2°C, and ultimately to 1.5°C .\r\nAnother innovative feature of this briefing paper then follows with a practical analysis of a range of\r\ninitiatives that, taken together, could have the potential to bring emissions from present projected\r\nlevels to those that are consistent with 2°C warming limit and assist national governments to\r\nimplement and strengthen their emission reduction pledges. We provide an overview of such\r\ninitiatives -often led by players other than national governments and in many cases driven by\r\nconcerns broader than climate change. Together, these initiatives could have the potential to bridge\r\nthe emissions gap.\r\nFinally we highlight further work needed to elaborate on the scientific issues, mitigation options and\r\nbarriers to their achievement in order to realise the possibilities outlined in the paper.",

While the country-level scale of emissions changes can be estimated in near-real-time, the more detailed, gridded emissions estimates that are required to run General Circulation Models (GCM) of the climate will take longer to collect. In this paper we use recorded and projected country-and-sector activity levels to modify gridded predictions from the MESSAGE-GLOBIOM SSP2-4.5 scenario. We provide updated projections for concentrations of greenhouse gases, emissions fields for aerosols and precursors, and the ozone and optical properties that result from this. The codebase to perform similar modifications to other scenarios is also provided. We outline the means by which these results may be used in a model intercomparison project (CovidMIP) to investigate the impact of national lockdown measures on climate. This includes three strands: an assessment of short-term effects (5-year period), of longer-term effects (30 years) and an investigation into the separate effects of changes in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. This last strand supports possible attribution of observed changes in the climate system, hence these simulations will also form part of the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP).",

The Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP) was established to gain a better understanding of the potential magnitude and sign of ZEC, in addition to the processes that underlie this metric. Eighteen Earth system models of both full and intermediate complexity participated in ZECMIP. All models conducted an experiment where atmospheric CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; concentration increases exponentially until 1000 PgC has been emitted. Thereafter emissions are set to zero and models are configured to allow free evolution of atmospheric CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; concentration. The inter-model range of ZEC 50 years after emissions cease for the 1000 PgC experiment is -0.36 to 0.29 &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;C with a model ensemble mean of -0.06 &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;C, median of -0.05 &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;C and standard deviation of 0.19 &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;C. Models exhibit a wide variety of behaviours after emissions cease, with some models continuing to warm for decades to millennia and others cooling substantially. Analysis shows that both ocean carbon uptake and carbon uptake by the terrestrial biosphere are important for counteracting the warming effect from reduction in ocean heat uptake in the decades after emissions cease.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Overall, the most likely value of ZEC on decadal time-scales is assessed to be close to zero, consistent with prior work. However substantial continued warming for decades or centuries following cessation of emission is a feature of a minority of the assessed models and thus cannot be ruled out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

Here, we present a set of global COVID-19 shock-and-recovery scenarios that systematically explore the demand-side effect on final energy and GHG emissions. Our pathways project final energy demand reductions of 12 to 40 EJ/yr by 2025 and cumulative CO2 emissions reductions by 2030 of 28 to 53 GtCO2, depending on the depth and duration of the economic downturn and demand-side changes. Recovering from the pandemic with low energy demand practices - embedded in new patterns of travel, work, consumption, and production – reduces climate mitigation challenges. A low energy demand recovery reduces carbon prices for a 1.5°C consistent pathway by 19%, lowers energy supply investments until 2030 by 2.1 trillion USD, and lessens pressure on the upscaling of renewable energy technologies.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Global agriculture is the second largest contributor to anthropogenic climate change after the burning of fossil fuels. However the potential to mitigate the agricultural climate change contribution is limited and must account for the imperative to supply food for the global population. Advances in microbial biomass cultivation technology have recently opened a pathway to growing substantial amounts of food for humans or livestock on a small fraction of the land presently used for agriculture. Here we investigate the potential climate change impacts of the end of agriculture as the primary human food production system. We find that replacing agricultural primary production with electrically powered microbial primary production before a low-carbon energy transition has been completed could redirect renewable energy away from replacing fossil fuels, potentially leading to higher total CO 2 emissions. If deployed after a transition to renewable energy, the technology could alleviate agriculturally driven climate change. These diverging pathways originate from the reversibility of agricultural driven global warming and the irreversibility of fossil-fuel CO 2 driven warming. The range of reduced warming from the replacement of agriculture ranges from −0.22 (−0.29 to −0.04) ∘ C for shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP)1 −1.9 to −0.85 (−0.99 to −0.39) ∘ C for SSP4-6.0. For limited temperature target overshoot scenarios, replacement of agriculture could eliminate or reduce the need for active atmospheric CO 2 removal to achieve the necessary peak and decline in global warming.",

                "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Under current emission trajectories, at least temporarily overshooting the Paris global warming limit of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels is a distinct possibility. Permanently exceeding this limit would substantially increase the risks of triggering several climate tipping elements with associated high-end impacts on human societies and the Earth system. It is essential to assess this risk under emission pathways that temporarily overshoot 1.5 °C. Here, we investigate the tipping risks associated with a number of policy-relevant future emission scenarios, using a stylised Earth system model that comprises four interconnected core tipping elements. We find that tipping risks until 2300 increase by 5 % for every tenth of a degree above 1.5 °C if global warming levels do not return to 1.5 °C or lower by the end of this century. If overshoots above 1.5 °C are limited in both peak temperature and duration (return below 1.5 °C in 2100), tipping risks until 2300 can be kept below 3 %. We show that achieving and maintaining at least net-zero greenhouse gas emissions is paramount to minimise tipping risks on multi-century timescales. Our results underscore that stringent emission reductions in the current decade in line with the Paris Agreement 1.5 °C limit are critical for planetary stability.",

Building on the 2012 report, turn down the heat: why a 4 degree celsius warmer world must be avoided, this new scientific analysis examines the likely impacts of present day, 2 degree celsius and 4 degree celsius warming on agricultural production, water resources, and coastal vulnerability for affected populations. It finds many significant climate and development impacts are already being felt in some regions, and in some cases multiple threats of increasing extreme heat waves, sea-level rise, more severe storms, droughts and floods are expected to have further severe negative implications for the poorest. Climate-related extreme events could push households below the poverty trap threshold. High temperature extremes appear likely to affect yields of rice, wheat, maize and other important crops, adversely affecting food security. Promoting economic growth and the eradication of poverty and inequality will thus be an increasingly challenging task under future climate change. Immediate steps are needed to help countries adapt to the risks already locked in at current levels of 0.8 degree celsius warming, but with ambitious global action to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, many of the worst projected climate impacts could still be avoided by holding warming below 2 degree celsius.",

                "abstract": "Abstract. The amount of additional future temperature change following a complete cessation of CO2 emissions is a measure of the unrealized warming to which we are committed due to CO2 already emitted to the atmosphere. This \"Zero Emissions Commitment\" (ZEC) is also an important quantity when estimating the remaining carbon budget – a limit on the total amount of CO2 emissions consistent with limiting global mean temperature at a particular level. In the recent IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C, the carbon budget framework used to calculate the remaining carbon budget for 1.5 °C included the assumption that the ZEC due to CO2 emissions is negligible and close to zero. Previous research has shown significant uncertainty even in the sign of the ZEC. To close this knowledge gap, we propose the Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP), which will quantify the amount of unrealized temperature change that occurs after CO2 emissions cease and investigate the geophysical drivers behind this climate response. Quantitative information on ZEC is a key gap in our knowledge, and one that will not be addressed by currently planned CMIP6 simulations, yet it is crucial for verifying whether carbon budgets need to be adjusted to account for any unrealized temperature change resulting from past CO2 emissions. We request only one top priority simulation from comprehensive general circulation Earth System Models (ESMs) and Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) – a branch from the 1 % CO2 run with CO2 emissions set to zero at the point of 1000 PgC of total CO2 emissions in the simulation – with the possibility for additional simulations, if resources allow. ZECMIP is part of CMIP6, under joint sponsorship by C4MIP and CDRMIP, with associated experiment names to enable data submissions to Earth System Grid Federation. All data will be published and made freely available.",

Carbon budget estimates are subject to uncertainty in the Transient Climate Response to Cumulative CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; Emissions (TCRE), which measures the warming resulting from a given total amount of CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; emitted. Moreover, other sources of uncertainty linked to non-CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; emissions have been shown to also strongly affect estimates of the remaining carbon budget. Here we present a new framework that estimates the TCRE using geophysical constraints derived from observations, and integrates the effect of geophysical and socioeconomic pathway uncertainties on the distribution of the remaining carbon budget. We estimate a median TCRE of 0.40 &amp;amp;#176;C and likely range of 0.3 to 0.5 &amp;amp;#176;C (17-83%) per 1000 GtCO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; emitted. Our 1.5 &amp;amp;#176;C remaining carbon budget has a median value of 710 GtCO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; from 2020 onwards, with a range of 470 to 960 GtCO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, (for a 67% to 33% chance of not exceeding the target). Uncertainty in the amount of current warming from non-CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; forcing is the dominant geophysical contributor to the spread in both the TCRE and remaining carbon budget estimates. The remaining carbon budget distribution is also strongly affected by current and future mitigation decisions, where the range of non-CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;forcing across scenarios has the potential to increase or decrease the median 1.5 &amp;amp;#176;C remaining carbon budget by 740 GtCO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

Critically, we also consider the feasibility of national long-term pledges towards net-zero, to understand where the challenges to achieving them could lie. Whilst near-term pledges alone lead to warming above 2°C, the addition of long-term pledges leads to emissions trajectories compatible with a well-below 2°C future, across all four IAMs. However, whilst IAM heterogeneity translates to diverse decarbonisation pathways towards long-term targets, all modelled pathways indicate several feasibility concerns, relating to the cost of mitigation, as well as to rates and scales of deployed technologies and measures.",

This has impacted many sectors of the global economy including the energy sector which has witnessed movements both towards and away from sustainability. Key trends observed include a reduced demand for both energy and energy services, zero to negative oil prices, disruptions in the supply chain of energy technologies and materials – specially for renewable energy, and a decline in investments. This has led to welcome reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, revealed opportunities for new and digitalized business models and responsible lifestyle choices, but all these will be short lived if we go back to business as usual.\r\nSuch behavioral and societal changes have revealed the potential for structural change and transitions in demand for energy services towards sustainability. An interesting revelation is that the positive fallouts for sustainable development are all related to what are commonly perceived to be difficult-to-overcome barriers such as lifestyle choices, behavior, and business models. Whereas the negative fallouts for sustainable development are the relatively easier to address issues of reinstating supply chains and kick-starting/accelerating investments in sustainable energy. As the world looks to recover from the economic and jobs related consequences of the pandemic, all stakeholders have a responsibility to ensure that we create a system of incentives to reward sustainable behavior while penalizing those actions that would take us back to the path of unsustainability. For the energy sector, this would translate not only to the choices that influence the supply of energy, including evaluating the balance of centralized and decentralized energy options, but also the choices that would impact the demand for energy itself! Re-examining these business models from the point of view of contributions to economic growth and jobs, while building on heightened awareness and a desire for green growth is the imperative.",

A large scientific community, typically using integrated assessment models and econometric frameworks, supports this assessment in understanding both near-term actions and long-term policy responses and goals related to mitigating global warming. WG3 must systematically assess hundreds of scenarios from the literature to gain an in-depth understanding of long-term emissions pathways, across all sectors, leading to various levels of global warming. Systematic assessment and understanding the climate outcomes of each emissions scenario, requires coordinated processes which have developed over consecutive IPCC assessments. Here, we give an overview of the processes involved in the systematic assessment of long-term mitigation pathways as used in recent IPCC Assessments&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; and being further developed for the IPCC 6&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;th&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; Assessment Report (AR6). The presentation will explain how modelling teams can submit scenarios to AR6 and invite feedback to the process.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Following discussions amongst IPCC Lead Authors to define the scope of scenarios desired and variables requested, a call for scenarios to support AR6 was launched in September 2019. Modelling teams have registered and submitted scenarios through Autumn 2019 using a new and secure online submission portal, from which authorised Lead Authors can interrogate the scenarios interactively.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This analysis is underpinned by the open-source software pyam, a Python package specifically designed for analysis and visualisation of integrated assessment scenarios&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;. Submitted scenarios are automatically checked for errors and processed using a new climate assessment pipeline. The climate assessment involves infilling and harmonization&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; of emissions data, then the scenarios are processed through Simple Climate Models, using the OpenSCM framework&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, to give probabilistic climate implications for each scenario &amp;amp;#8211; atmospheric concentrations, radiative forcing and global mean temperature. The climate assessment accounts for updated climate sensitivity estimates from CMIP6 and WG1,s scenarios are categorized according to climate outcomes and distinguish between timing and levels of net-negative emissions, emissions peak and temperature overshoot. Scenarios are also categorized by other indicators, for consistent use across WG3 chapters, such as: population and GDP; Primary and Final energy use; and shares of renewables, bioenergy and fossil fuels.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The automated framework also facilitates bolt-on analyses, such as estimating the population impacted by biophysical climate impacts&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;5&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, and estimates of avoided damages with the social cost of carbon&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;6&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Upon publication of the WG3 AR6 report, all scenario data used in the WG3 Assessment will be publicly available on a Scenario Explorer, an online tool for interrogating and visualizing the data that supports the report.

                "abstract": "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Will a new-born experience more impacts from climate change compared to a 60-year old? While the obvious answer to this question is yes, impacts accumulated across an average person&amp;amp;#8217;s lifetime have so far not been quantified. Providing such information is however relevant and timely, given the recent surge in societal debate regarding inter-generational solidarity and considering ongoing climate litigation. Here we combine multi-model impact projections from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) with temperature trajectories from the IPCC special report on warming of 1.5&amp;amp;#176;C and life expectancy data from the World Bank to compute accumulated impact exposure across lifetimes of people in different age groups and countries. We consider six impacts categories (droughts, heatwaves, tropical cyclones, crop failure, floods, and wildfires), for which ISIMIP provides a total of 170 impact projections with 15 different impact models under RCP2.6 and 6.0. Our results highlight that the combined increase in life expectancy and unfolding climate impacts leads to 2-4 times more impacts affecting a new-born compared to a 60-year old person under current policy pledges. Globally, the increase in exposure for young people is dominated by the strong increase in heatwave hazards. The strongest increases occur in low and lower-middle income countries, where rising impacts compound a substantial increase in life expectancy. Our results overall highlight the strong benefit of aligning policies with the Paris Agreement for safeguarding the future of current young generations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

                "abstract": "Current analyses of pathways limiting global warming to well below 2°C, as called for in the Paris Agreement, do not consider the climate impacts already occurring below 2°C. Here we show that accounting for these damages significantly increases the near-term ambition of transformation pathways. We use econometric estimates of climate damages on GDP growth and explicitly model the uncertainty in the time that damages persist and in the climate sensitivity. We find that carbon prices in 2030 are higher compared to the case where only the 2°C is considered; the median value is $115 per tonne of CO2. The long-term persistence of damages, while highly uncertain, is a main driver of optimal near-term climate policy. Accounting for damages on economic growth increases the gap between the currently pledged nationally determined contributions and the welfare-optimal 2030 emissions for 2°C by two thirds, compared to pathways considering the 2°C limit only.",

                "abstract": "Abstract The transition towards a low-carbon power system presents immense challenges and opportunities to the workforce. Studies of the energy transition’s regional and distributional employment impacts are mainly qualitative or disconnected from prevailing energy modeling scenarios. Here, we couple a power sector optimization model, an employment impact model, and demographic databases to further understand the state-level job characteristics and societal implications in the US. Major fossil fuel producers risk job losses even without new emission reduction policies, requiring the reskilling of up to 30% of the current workforce. The results highlight the need for investments in human capital and a supply chain restructuring. Blue-collar workers are crucial to delivering the transition. Expanding renewable energy could improve job opportunities for women in states dependent on fossil fuels, but not enough to disrupt the national status quo. This work sets a new quantitative perspective to inform proactive local Just Transition policymaking.",

                "abstract": "Climate impacts have been studied intensively and our understanding of changes in climate impacts due to anthropogenic activity is impressive (see IPCC AR6). There is, however, a gap between the physical understanding of changes in climate impacts and availability of information that could directly be used by adaptation planners. We argue that this gap is to a large extent a result of the usual modeling chain that is based on a handful of representative emission scenarios.Most climate change studies take a small, predefined set of emission scenarios (SSP2-45, SSP1-26, SSP5-85 etc.) and calculate the global and regional climate impacts resulting from these. Focusing on a limited set of emission scenarios allows us to compare results from different modeling groups and lets us run detailed climate models on each scenario. However, this modeling approach does not align with relevant research questions such as: &amp;#8220;How much can be emitted to avoid a certain impact?&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;what are the emission constraints to limit the probability of experiencing a certain event until 2050 to 10%?&amp;#8221;The presented reversal of the impact chain would help to answer these questions. The idea is to start from a clearly defined impact and evolve uncertainties backwards into the emission space. Doing so, we take the perspective of practitioners who know very well what impacts are of relevance and would like to know how these impacts are related to greenhouse gas emissions.",

We know that excess carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere causes global warming, but when we stop emitting CO 2 –a goal known as net zero—will warming stop at the same time? Our best understanding is that no more CO 2 emissions means no more warming, but we are not completely sure about this. The extra change in temperature after we reach net zero emissions is called the zero emissions commitment. In this article, we explain how understanding the way heat and carbon move around the Earth is key to working out whether we will get more global warming after net zero, see some cooling, or perhaps experience no change in Earth’s temperature at all.",

Recent exponential growth in literature is rapidly filling this gap but makes the synthesis of the evidence on CDR side effects increasingly challenging. We address this issue by mapping this literature and proposing a taxonomy to synthesize and compare evidence on CDR side effects. The expansive evidence warrants the use of machine learning to systematically select relevant research and provide an inventory of nearly 400 side effects and challenges. We find rich evidence in Europe but little information for Africa, South America, and Oceania, where large-scale CDR is nevertheless projected. There is a predominance of articles discussing negative effects compared to positive ones. Starting from the limitations of our analysis and literature gaps, we provide entry points for future studies that can build on our literature-based taxonomy.",

                "abstract": "The vast majority of scenarios assessed in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report fail to sufficiently analyze some of the critical linkages between climate and development. We use an integrated assessment modeling framework—the MESSAGE-Access model—to explore the effects of climate policy on the feasibility and costs of achieving a universal clean cooking goal by 2030 in South Asia. We analyze the interaction between these goals using a wide range of scenarios of mitigation stringency and access policy mechanisms, with particular attention to the distributional effects on different urban/rural and income groups. This analysis is made possible by the application of a novel two-stage optimization framework that combines a household-decision model with a social-choice model.\r\n\r\nWe find that achieving universal clean cooking by 2030 will require substantial policy efforts and costs even in a world without climate policies, but costs could be up to 44% higher under stringent climate mitigation. Notably, the incremental costs associated with stringent mitigation fall well within the possible range of policy costs from inefficient access support policies.",

                "abstract": "Governments worldwide have agreed that international climate policy should aim to limit the increase of global mean temperature to less than 2oC with respect to pre-industrial levels. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the emission reductions and related energy system changes in various countries in pathways consistent with the 2oC target. We synthesize and provide an overview of the national and regional information contained in different scenarios from various global models published over the last few years, as well as yet unpublished scenarios submitted by modelling teams participating in the MILES project (Modelling and Informing Low-Emission Strategies). We find that emissions in the mitigation scenarios are significantly reduced in all regions compared to the baseline without climate policies. The regional cumulative CO2 emissions show on average a 76% reduction between the baseline and 450 scenario. The 450 scenarios show a reduction of primary energy demand in all countries of roughly 30-40% compared to the baseline. In the baseline scenario, the contribution of low-carbon energy technology remains around 15%, i.e. similar as today. In the mitigation scenario, these numbers are scaled up rapidly towards 2050. Looking at air quality, sulphur dioxide and black carbon emissions are strongly reduced as a co-benefit of greenhouse gas emission reductions, in both developing and developed countries. However, black carbon emissions increase in countries that strongly rely on bioenergy to reach mitigation targets. Concerning energy security, energy importing countries generally experience a decrease in net-energy imports in mitigation scenarios compared to the baseline development, while energy exporters experience a loss of energy export revenues.",

Immediate steps are needed to help countries adapt to the risks already locked in at current levels of 0.8 degree celsius warming, but with ambitious global action to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, many of the worst projected climate impacts could still be avoided by holding warming below 2 degree celsius.",

                "abstract": "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Consistent and comparable climate assessments of scenarios are critical within the context of IPCC assessment reports. Given the number of scenarios assessed by WG3, the assessment &amp;amp;#8220;pipeline&amp;amp;#8221; must be almost completely automated. Here, we present the application of a new assessment pipeline which combines state-of-the-art components into a single workflow in order to derive climate outcomes for integrated assessment model (IAM) scenarios assessed by WG3 of the IPCC. A consistent analysis ensures that WG3&amp;amp;#8217;s conclusions about the socioeconomic transformations required to maintain a safe climate are based on the best understanding of our planetary boundaries from WG1. For example, if WG1 determines that climate sensitivity is higher than previously considered, then WG3 could incorporate this insight by e.g. considering much smaller remaining carbon budgets for any given temperature target.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The scenario-climate assessment pipeline is comprised of three primary components. First, a consistent harmonization algorithm which maintains critical model characteristics between harmonized and unharmonized scenarios [1] is employed to harmonize emissions trajectories to a common and consistent historical dataset as used in CMIP6 [2]. Next, a scenario&amp;amp;#8217;s reported emissions trajectories are analyzed as to the completeness of its species and sectoral coverage. A consistent set of 14 emissions species are expected, aligning with published work within ScenarioMIP and CMIP6 (see ref [2], Table 2). Should any component of this full set of emissions trajectories be absent for a given scenario, an algorithm (e.g., generalised quantile walk [3]) is employed in order to &amp;amp;#8220;back-fill&amp;amp;#8221; missing species at the native model regional resolution. Finally, full emissions scenarios are analyzed by an Earth System Model emulator, e.g., MAGICC [4].&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this presentation, we explore differences in climate assessments and estimated remaining carbon budgets across various components of the pipeline for available scenarios in the literature. We consider the impact of alternative choices, especially those made in prior assessments by the IPCC (AR5, SR15), including, for example, the historical emissions database used, the effect of harmonization and back-filling, as well as the version and setup of MAGICC used.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;References&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[1] Gidden, M.J., Fujimori, S., van den Berg, M., Klein, D., Smith, S.J., van Vuuren, D.P. and Riahi, K., 2018.

                "abstract": "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Current and projected emissions trends suggest a likely reliance on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to achieve the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. Studies using Integrated Assessment Models have considered scenarios limiting global warming to 1.5&amp;amp;#176;C in 2100 that include cumulative net removal of up to ~1000 GtCO2 over the 21&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;st&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; century, although also scenarios deploying substantially less CDR have been considered. Large CDR deployment beyond achieving net zero emissions is often assumed to achieve a Global Mean Temperature (GMT) decline after peak warming of several tenths of a degree by the end of the century. The feasibility of achieving CDR on such a large scale has been strongly contested for environmental, technological, geophysical, economic, institutional or socio-cultural reasons. Beyond these considerations, it is important to assess the possible realisation of a GMT decline in the context of &amp;amp;#160;uncertainties in the Earth System response.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Here we attempt to review and compare these various sources of uncertainty. Some relevant Earth System feedbacks &amp;amp;#160;are not represented in climate models or only in a limited manner, such as carbon release from permafrost melting, wetlands and wildfires, which could release ~100 GtCO2 over the 21&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;st&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; century even in stringent mitigation scenarios, but there is low confidence around this number. Another source of uncertainty is the Zero Emissions Commitment, which quantifies how much global warming would occur after global CO2 emissions reach net zero. Its best estimate over 50 years is close to zero, but uncertainties were quantified to be as high as +/-0.3&amp;amp;#176;C for cumulative emissions of 1000 PgC and uncertainties remain on the potential for warming on multi century timescales. Given this, additional post net-zero warming countering CDR induced cooling cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the TCRE assessed for increasing CO2 emissions would remain the same once we reach net-negative emissions. In light of these various sources of uncertainty we argue that a broader perspective on CDR and future GMT evolution beyond net zero is advisable. Acknowledging the uncertain efficacy of CDR-induced GMT decrease is important for comprehensive risk assessments and reflections on scenario design.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

However, how a post-pandemic recovery will impact longer-term transformations to a low-carbon society is unclear. Here, we present different global COVID-19 shock-and-recovery scenarios that systematically explore economic uncertainty and the demand-side effect on emissions. We consider changes in the residential, industry and transport energy sub-sectors under diverging cases that might lead to a more carbon intensive and individualistic way of consumption, or to a policy-advised new future that supports the emission reduction opportunities seen during the pandemic. The resulting impact on cumulative CO2 emissions over the coming decade can range from 28 to 53 GtCO2 reduction depending on the depth and duration of the economic downturn and the extent and persistence of demand-side changes. Recovering from the pandemic with low energy demand practices - embedded in new patterns of travel, work, consumption, and production &amp;amp;#8211; reduces climate mitigation challenges in the long run. We show that a low energy demand recovery reduces carbon prices for a 1.5&amp;amp;#176;C consistent pathway by 19%, saves energy supply investments until 2030 by 2.1 trillion USD, and lessens pressure on the upscaling of renewable energy technologies.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

This has given rise to a class of overshoot emissions pathways in the mitigation literature that limit warming to such thresholds only after allowing for a temporary overshoot. However, substantial biogeophysical uncertainties remain regarding the large-scale deployment of Carbon Dioxide Removal technologies required to potentially reverse global warming. Additionally, beyond global mean temperature very little is known about the benefits of declining temperatures on impacts and adaptation needs. Here we will provide an overview of the current state of understanding regarding the reversibility of global warming, as well as impacts and adaptation needs under overshoot pathways.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We highlight the characteristics of the overshoot scenarios from the literature, and especially those that are compatible with identified sustainability limits for Carbon Dioxide Removal deployment. We will compare those characteristics with uncertainties arising from the Earth System&amp;amp;#8217;s response which may complicate the efforts to achieve a decrease in Global Mean Temperature after peak warming is reached. This part will include latest results of the permafrost carbon feedback under stylized overshoot scenarios. Eventually, we will summarise the state-of-the-art knowledge and present new results regarding the impacts of overshoot scenarios for non-linear and time-lagged responses such as sea-level rise, permafrost and glaciers. This will allow for a preliminary assessment of the impact and adaptation benefits of early mitigation compatible with a no or low overshoot pathways.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

The Paris Agreement also sets a net emissions reduction goal: in the second half of the century, the balance of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and removals should become net zero. Since 2018, in response to the publication of the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5&amp;amp;#176;C, a flurry of net zero target announcements has ensued. Many countries, cities, regions, companies, or other organisations have come forward with targets to reach net zero, or become carbon or climate neutral. These labels describe a wide variety of targets, and rarely detailed. Lack of transparency renders it impossible to understand their ultimate contribution towards the global goal. Here we present a set of key criteria that high-quality net zero targets should address. These nine criteria cover emissions, removals, timing, fairness and a long-term vision. Unless net zero targets provide clarity on these nine criteria, we may not know until it is too late whether the collective promise of net zero targets is adequate to meet the global goal of the Paris Agreement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

                "abstract": "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Global agriculture is the second largest contributor to anthropogenic climate change after the burning of fossil fuels. However the potential to mitigate the agricultural contribution is limited by the imperative to supply food for the global population. Advances in microbial biomass cultivation technology have recently opened a pathway to growing substantial amounts of food for humans or livestock, by fuelling microbial growth with hydrogen produced from electrolysis powered by renewable energy. This method of food production would use a small fraction of the land presently used for agriculture. Here we investigate the potential climate change impacts of the end of agriculture as the primary human food production system. We find that microbial biomass cultivation technology has both the potential to exacerbate climate change by outcompeting economic decarbonization for renewable energy and the potential to mitigate climate change if deployed following economic decarbonization. A duality which originates from the contrast between the reversibility of agricultural driven climate change and the irreversibility of fossil-fuel CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; driven climate change. The range of reduced warming from the replacement of agriculture ranges from -0.22 [-0.29 to -0.04]&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;C for Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 1-1.9 to -0.85 [-0.99 to -0.39]&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;o&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;C for SSP4-6.0. For limited temperature target overshoot scenarios, replacement of agriculture could thus eliminate or reduce the need for active atmospheric CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; removal to achieve the necessary peak and decline in global warming. Given current societal barriers to switching to a microbial-based diet, deep near-term emissions reductions in CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; and agricultural emissions remain necessary steps to keep warming within the bounds set by the Paris Agreement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

                "title": "Implication of the reduction in anthropogenic aerosols due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the future recovery scenarios for radiative forcing",
                "abstract": "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented reductions in socio-economic activities. Associated decreases in anthropogenic aerosol emissions are not represented in the original CMIP6 emission scenarios. Here we estimate the implications of the pandemic for the aerosol forcing in 2020 and quantify the spread in aerosol forcing associated with the differences in the post-pandemic recovery pathways. To this end, we use new emission scenarios taking the COVID-19 crisis into account and projecting different socio-economic developments until 2050 with fossil-fuel based and green pathways (Forster et al., 2020). We use the new emission data to generate input for the anthropogenic aerosol parameterization MACv2-SP for CMIP6 models. In this presentation, we first show the results for the anthropogenic aerosol optical depth and associated effects on clouds from the new MACv2-SP data for 2020 to 2050 (Fiedler et al., in review). We then use the MACv2-SP data to provide estimates of the effective radiative effects of the anthropogenic aerosols for 2020 and 2050. Our forcing estimates are based on new atmosphere-only simulations with the CMIP6 model EC-Earth3. The model uses MACv2-SP to represent aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions including aerosol effects on cloud lifetime. For each anthropogenic aerosol pattern, we run EC-Earth3 simulations for fifty years to substantially reduce the impact of model-internal variability on the forcing estimate. Our results highlight: (1) a change of +0.04 Wm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; in the global mean effective radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols for 2020 due to the pandemic, which is small compared to the magnitude of internal variability, (2) a spread of -0.38 to -0.68 Wm&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; for the effective radiative forcing associated with anthropogenic aerosols in 2050 depending on the recovery scenario in MACv2-SP, and (3) a more negative (stronger) anthropogenic aerosol forcing for a strong green than a moderate green development in 2050 due to higher ammonium emissions in a highly decarbonized society (Fiedler et al., in review). The new MACv2-SP data are now used in climate models participating in the model intercomparison project on the climate response to the COVID-19 crisis (Covid-MIP, Jones et al., in review, Lamboll et al., in review).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;References:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fiedler, S., Wyser, K., Joeri, R., and van Noije, T.: Radiative effects of reduced aerosol emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic and the future recovery, in review, [preprint] https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10504704.1.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Forster, P.M., Forster, H.I., Evans, M.J.&amp;amp;#160;et al.:&amp;amp;#160;Current and future global climate impacts resulting from COVID-19.&amp;amp;#160;Nat.

We draw on a technology-rich, regionally disaggregated Integrated Assessment Model representing energy system, agricultural and land-based greenhouse gas emissions, a reduced complexity climate model to simulate probabilistic global temperature changes over the 21st century, and a suite of impacts models to estimate regional climate-related physical hazards and impacts deriving from the temperature change pathways and their underlying socio-economics.

By 2050, physical risks deriving from major heatwaves, agricultural drought, heat stress and crop duration reductions depend greatly on the temperature pathway. By 2030, transition risks most sensitive to temperature pathways stem from economy-wide mitigation costs, carbon price increases, fossil fuel demand reductions and potential stranding of carbon-intensive assets such as coal-fired power stations. The more stringent the mitigation action, the higher the abatement costs and sector-specific transition risks. However, such scenarios result in lower physical climate hazards throughout the century.

Current policies towards climate mitigation would result in about twice as much warming over the next 80 years, roughly the lifetime of a today's newborn. Here we quantify the stronger climate change burden that will fall on younger generations by introducing a novel analysis framework that expresses impacts as a function of how they are experienced along the course of a person's life. Combining projections of population, temperature, and 15 impact models encompassing droughts, heatwaves, tropical cyclones, crop failure, floods, and wildfires, we show that, under current climate pledges, newborns in 2020 are projected to experience 2-13 times more extreme events during their life than a person born in 1960, with substantial variations across regions. Limiting warming to 1.5&amp;amp;#176;C consistently reduces that burden, while still leaving younger generations with unavoidable impacts that are unmatched by the impacts experienced by older generations. Our results provide a quantified scientific basis to understand the position from which younger generations challenge the present shortfall of adequate climate action.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

                "abstract": "Background Pachyonychia congenita (PC) refers to a group of autosomal dominant disorders caused by mutations in five keratin genes (KRT16,KRT6A,KRT17,KRT6B or KRT6C). Current disease classification is based on the gene harbouring disease-causing variants. Aims We harnessed the International Pachyonychia Congenita Research Registry (IPCRR) containing both clinical and molecular data on patients with PC worldwide, to identify genetic variants predicting disease severity. Methods We ascertained 815 individuals harbouring keratin mutations registered in the IPCRR. We looked for statistically significant associations between genetic variants and clinical manifestations in a subgroup of patients carrying mutations found in at least 10% of the cohort. Data were analysed using χ2 and Kruskal–Wallis tests. Results We identified five mutations occurring in at least 10% of the patients registered in the IPCRR. The KRT16 p.L132P mutation was significantly associated with younger age of onset, presence of palmar keratoderma oral leucokeratosis and a higher number of involved nails. By contrast, the KRT16 p.N125S and p.R127C mutations resulted in a milder phenotype featuring a decreased number of involved nails and older age of onset. Patients carrying the p.N125S mutation were less likely to develop palmar keratoderma while p.R127C was associated with an older age of palmoplantar keratoderma onset. Moreover, the KRT17 p.L99P mutation resulted in an increased number of involved fingernails and patients demonstrating 20-nail dystrophy, while the opposite findings were observed with KRT17 p.N92S mutation. Conclusions We have identified novel and clinically useful genetic predictive variants in the largest cohort of patients with PC described to date.",

                "abstract": "Thermophoresis causes particles to move down a temperature gradient to a cooler region of a neutral gas. An example is the temperature gradient in the gas around a large cold object, such as an aggregate of particles, cooled by radiation in a protoplanetary disc. Particles near this aggregate move down the temperature gradient to the aggregate, equivalent to the particles being attracted to it by an inter-particle thermophoretic force. This force is proportional to the temperature difference between gas and aggregate, to the gas density and to the cross-section of the aggregate. The force can be large. For example, calculations based on the equations of motion of the interacting particles show that it can be large enough in an optically thin environment to increase the rate of aggregation by up to six orders of magnitude when an aggregate radius lies between 0.1 μm and 1 mm. From 1 mm to about 10 cm aggregates drift inwards through the gas too quickly for the thermophoretic attraction to increase aggregation significantly; so they grow slowly, causing an observed accumulation of particles at these sizes. Particles above 10 cm move more quickly, causing aggregation due to collisions, but also causing fragmentation. However, calculations show that fragmenting particles and bouncing particles in inelastic collisions often have low enough relative velocities that thermophoresis brings them together again. This allows particles to grow above 1 m, which is otherwise difficult to explain.",

This innovation can increase data rates of space-to-ground communication links, and has potential application to NASA s future spacebased Earth observation system. The SDM incorporates an extended version of the industry-standard DVB-S2, and LDPC rate 9/10 FEC codec. The SDM supports a suite of waveforms, including QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-APSK, 32- APSK, 64-APSK, and 128-QAM. The Ka-band and TWTA deliver an output power on the order of 200 W with efficiency greater than 60%, and a passband of at least 3 GHz. The modem and the TWTA together enable a data rate of 20 Gbps with a low bit error rate (BER). The payload data rates for spacecraft in NASA s integrated space communications network can be increased by an order of magnitude (>10 ) over current state-of-practice. This innovation enhances the data rate by using bandwidth-efficient modulation techniques, which transmit a higher number of bits per Hertz of bandwidth than the currently used quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) waveforms.",

                "abstract": "The magnesium methyl and the calcium and strontium silylamide β-diketiminate derivatives [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}MX(THF)n] (M = Mg, X = CH3, n = 0; M = Ca, X = N(SiMe3)2, n = 0 or 1; M = Sr, X = N(SiMe3)2, n = 1, Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl), the silylamides [M{N(SiMe3)2}2]2 and [M{N(SiMe3)2}2(THF)2] (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba), and the alkyl species [M{CH(SiMe3)2}2(THF)2] (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) have been studied as precatalysts for the hydroamination/cyclization of aminoalkenes. Hydroamination afforded a series of five- and six-membered pyrrolidine and piperidine derivatives in near quantitative yields with all precatalysts, apart from the barium species, which were apparently limited to a maximum of two turnovers with even the favorable 1-amino-2,2-diphenyl-4-pentene substrate. Significant formation of hexahydroazepines was observed only with the magnesium amide species, while the group 2 dialkyl derivatives decomposed at high reaction temperatures and proved to be more limited in scope. In general, the calcium precatalysts proved to be more reactive than their strontium analogues, which, in turn, proved to be far more reactive than the magnesium species. Among the β-diketiminate derivatives, the greater coordinative unsaturation of the THF-free calcium derivative provided increased activity for the cyclization of primary aminoalkene substrates in comparison to its THF-solvated counterpart. In contrast, the unsolvated bis(amides) displayed lower activity with these substrates than their THF-solvated analogues. Use of silylamide precatalysts provides potentially reversible entry into the catalytic manifold. The position of the equilibrium is perturbed by both the nature of the substrate and the identity of the group 2 element, highlighted by the reaction of [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}Sr{N(SiMe3)2(THF)] with 2-methoxyethylamine, which results in equilibration between the starting silylamide, an isolable amine adduct, and the product of amine/silylamide transamination. Performing the same reaction with the calcium precatalyst provided the analogue of the latter product as the only observable species. A kinetic study of the cyclization of (1-allylcyclohexyl)methanamine with each of the calcium and strontium silylamide precatalysts provided an apparent first-order dependence in [catalyst], while determination of the activation barriers and Eyring analyses provided quantitative evidence that the group 2 catalysts reported herein provide activities at least commensurate with previously reported lanthanide-based catalyses. In the particular cases of systems based upon calcium and strontium, an enhanced catalytic performance is proposed to arise from a tangible entropic advantage resulting from the reduced charge density of the larger divalent alkaline earth cations and consequentially less constrained rate-determining alkene insertion transition states. The rate of cyclization was also found to decrease with increasing substrate concentration. This latter observation, along with the observation of large kinetic isotope effects (>4), proposed to be a result of a beneficial and concerted proton transfer step associated with rate-determining alkene insertion, are reasoned to be consistent with Michaelis−Menten-type kinetics.",

The presence of fluorine substituents reduces the ability to donate π-electron density from the arene and consequently fluorobenzenes generally bind weakly to metal centres, allowing them to be used as essentially non-coordinating solvents or as readily displaced ligands. In this context, examples of well-defined complexes of fluorobenzenes are discussed, including trends in binding strength with increasing fluorination and different substitution patterns. Compared to more highly fluorinated benzenes, FB and 1,2-DiFB typically demonstrate greater chemical inertness, however, C-H and C-F bond activation reactions can be induced using appropriately reactive transition metal complexes. Such reactions are surveyed, including catalytic examples, not only to provide perspective for the use of FB and 1,2-DiFB as innocent solvent media, but also to highlight opportunities for their exploitation in contemporary organic synthesis.",

Mechanistic studies show that two mechanisms are likely in operation: 1) direct oxidative addition of the C-F bond to AlI occurs with retention of alkene stereochemistry, and 2) stepwise formation and decomposition of a metallocyclopropane intermediate occurs with inversion of alkene stereochemistry. As part of this mechanistic analysis, we have isolated the first aluminium metallocyclopropane complex from oxidative addition of an alkene to AlI . Remarkably this reaction is reversible and reductive elimination of the alkene occurs at higher temperature reforming AlI .

                "abstract": "Through a combined experimental and computational (DFT) approach, the reaction mechanism of the addition of fluoroarenes to Mg-Mg bonds has been determined as a concerted SNAr-like pathway in which one Mg centre acts as a nucleophile and the other an electrophile. The experimentally determined Gibbs activation energy for the addition of C6F6 to a Mg-Mg bond of a molecular complex, ΔG‡298 K(experiment) = 21.3 kcal mol-1 is modelled by DFT with the ωB97X functional, ΔG‡298 K(DFT) = 25.7 kcal mol-1. The transition state for C-F activation involves a polarisation of the Mg-Mg bond and significant negative charge localisation on the fluoroarene moiety. This transition state is augmented by stabilising closed-shell Mg···F ortho interactions that, in combination with the known trends in C-F and C-M bond strengths in fluoroarenes, provide an explanation for the experimentally determined preference for C-F bond activation to occur at sites flanked by ortho-fluorine atoms. The effect of modification of both the ligand coordination sphere and the nature and polarity of the M-M bond (M = Mg, Zn, Al) on C-F activation has been investigated. A series of highly novel β-diketiminate stabilised complexes containing Zn-Mg, Zn-Zn-Zn, Zn-Al and Mg-Al bonds has been prepared, including the first crystallographic characterisation of a Mg-Al bond. Reactions of these new M-M containing complexes with perfluoroarenes were conducted and modelled by DFT. C-F bond activation is dictated by the steric accessibility, and not the polarity, of the M-M bond. The more open coordination complexes lead to enhanced Mg···F ortho interactions which in turn lower the energy of the transition states for C-F bond activation.",

Here, we report the C–H activation of styrenes by a well-defined bimetallic Fe–Al complex. These reactions are highly selective, resulting in the (E)-β-metalation of the alkene. For this bimetallic system, alkene binding appears to be essential for the reaction to occur. Experimental and computational insights suggest an unusual reaction pathway in which a (2 + 2) cycloaddition intermediate is directly converted into the hydrido vinyl product via an intramolecular sp2 C–H bond activation across the two metals. The key C–H cleavage step proceeds through a highly asynchronous transition state near the boundary between a concerted and a stepwise mechanism influenced by the resonance stabilization ability of the aryl substituent. The metalated alkenes can be further functionalized, which has been demonstrated by the (E)-selective phosphination of the employed styrenes.",

The metric parameters about the metal center and the pre-edge region of the Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectrum were reproduced by density functional theory (DFT), providing a qualitative description of the Co–NO bonding interaction as a Co(II) (SCo = 3/2) metal center, antiferromagnetically coupled to a triplet NO– anion (SNO = 1), an interpretation of the electronic structure that was validated by ab initio multireference methods (CASSCF/MRCI). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy revealed significant g-anisotropy in the S = 1/2 ground state, but the linear-response DFT performed poorly at calculating the g-values. Instead, CASSCF/MRCI computational studies in conjunction with quasi-degenerate perturbation theory with respect to spin–orbit coupling were required for obtaining accurate modeling of the molecular g-tensor. The computational portion of this work was extended to the diamagnetic Ni analogue of the Co complex, Tp*Ni(NO), which was found to consist of a Ni(II) (SNi = 1) metal center antiferromagnetically coupled to an SNO = 1 NO–. The similarity between the Co and Ni complexes contrasts with the previously studied Cu analogues, for which a Cu(I) bound to NO0 formulation has been described. This discrepancy will be discussed along with a comparison of the DFT and ab initio computational methods for their ability to predict various spectroscopic and molecular features.",

Fischer-Tropsch catalysis produces energy dense liquid hydrocarbons from synthesis gas (CO and H2) and has been a mainstay of the energy economy since its discovery nearly a century ago. Despite detailed studies aimed at elucidating the steps of catalysis, experimental evidence for chain growth (C n → C n+1; n ≥ 2) from the coupling of CO units on metal complexes is, to the best of our knowledge, unprecedented. In this paper, we show that carbon chains can be grown from sequential reactions of CO or CO2 with a transition metal carbonyl complex. By exploiting the cooperative effect of transition and main group metals, we document the first example of chain propagation from sequential coupling of CO units (C1 → C3 → C4), along with the first example of incorporation of CO2 into the growing carbon chain.",

This mechanism has been examined by stereochemical experiments and DFT calculations. The stereochemical experiments show that the (4 + 1) cycloaddition follows a suprafacial topology, while calculations support a concerted albeit asynchronous pathway in which the transition state demonstrates aromatic character. Remarkably, the substrate scope of the (4 + 1) cycloaddition includes styene, 1,1-diphenylethylene, and anthracene. In these cases, the diene motif is either in part, or entirely, contained within an aromatic ring and reactions occur with dearomatisation of the substrate and can be reversible. In the case of 1,2-cyclononadiene or 1,5-cyclooctadiene, complementary reactivity is observed; the orthogonal nature of the C═C π-bonds (1,2-diene) and the homoconjugated system (1,5-diene) both disfavor a (4 + 1) cycloaddition. Rather, reaction pathways are determined by an initial (2 + 1) cycloaddition to form an aluminocyclopropane intermediate which can in turn undergo insertion of a further C═C π-bond, leading to complex organometallic products that incorporate fused hydrocarbon rings.",

                "abstract": "The reactions of transition metal complexes underpin numerous synthetic processes and catalytic transformations. Typically, this reactivity involves the participation of empty and filled molecular orbitals centered on the transition metal. Kinetically stabilized species, such as octahedral low-spin d6 transition metal complexes, are not expected to participate directly in these reactions. However, novel approaches that exploit metal–ligand cooperativity offer an opportunity to challenge these preconceptions. Here, we show that inclusion of an aluminum-based ligand into the coordination sphere of neutral low-spin d6 iron complex leads to unexpected reactivity. Complexes featuring an unsupported Fe–Al bond are capable of the intermolecular C–H bond activation of pyridines. Mechanistic analysis suggests that C–H activation proceeds through a reductive deprotonation in which the two metal centers (Fe and Al) act like a frustrated Lewis pair. The key to this behavior is a ground state destabilization of the d6 iron complex, brought about by the inclusion of the electropositive aluminum-based ligand. These findings have immediate implications for the design of reagents and catalysts based on first-row transition metals.",

The mechanism of this reaction has been probed through stoichiometric experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The combined evidence suggests that H2 activation occurs by addition across the Zn–N bond via a four-membered transition state in which the Zn and N atoms play a dual role of Lewis acid and Lewis base. The zinc hydride complex that results from H2 addition has been shown to be remarkably effective for the hydrozincation of C═C bonds at modest temperatures. The scope of hydrozincation includes alkynes, alkenes, and a 1,3-butadiyne. For alkynes, the hydrozincation step is stereospecific leading exclusively to the syn-isomer. Competition experiments show that the hydrozincation of alkynes is faster than the equivalent alkene substrates. These new discoveries have been used to develop a catalytic system for the semi-hydrogenation of alkynes. The catalytic scope includes both aryl- and alkyl-substituted internal alkynes and proceeds with high alkene: alkane, Z:E ratios, and modest functional group tolerance. This work offers a first example of selective hydrogenation catalysis using zinc complexes.",

These reactions break strong sp 2 and sp 3 C−F bonds, and result in the formation of a diverse array of organoaluminium compounds. Mechanistic studies show that two mechanisms are likely in operation: 1) direct oxidative addition of the C−F bond to Al I occurs with retention of alkene stereochemistry, and 2) stepwise formation and decomposition of a metallocyclopropane intermediate occurs with inversion of alkene stereochemistry. As part of this mechanistic analysis, we have isolated the first aluminium metallocyclopropane complex from oxidative addition of an alkene to Al I . Remarkably this reaction is reversible and reductive elimination of the alkene occurs at higher temperature reforming Al I . Furthermore, in selected cases the organoaluminium products are susceptible toward β‐fluoride elimination to yield a double C−F activation pathway.",

                "abstract": "HF transfer reactions between organic substrates are potentially useful transformations. Such reactions require the development of catalytic systems that can promote both defluorination and fluorination steps in a single reaction sequence. Herein, we report a catalytic protocol in which an equivalent of HF is generated from a perfluoroarene | nucleophile pair and transferred directly to an alkyne. The reaction is catalyzed by [Au(IPr)NiPr2] (IPr = N,N'-1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene). HF transfer generates two useful products in the form of functionalized fluoroarenes and fluoroalkenes. Mechanistic studies (rate laws, KIEs, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, competition experiments) are consistent with the Au(I) catalyst facilitating a catalytic network involving both concerted SNAr and hydrofluorination steps. The nature of the nucleophile impacts the turnover-limiting step. The cSNAr step is turnover-limiting for phenol-based nucleophiles, while protodeuaration likely becomes turnover-limiting for aniline-based nucleophiles. The approach removes the need for direct handling of HF reagents in hydrofluorination and offers possibilities to manipulate the fluorine content of organic molecules through catalysis.",

A related zinc complex containing two [B=C] − ligands was prepared as a further point of comparison for the η 1 coordination mode. The bonding in these new complexes has been interrogated by computational techniques (QTAIM, NBO, ETS‐NOCV) and rationalised in terms of the Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model. The combined structural and computational data provide unique insight into catalytically relevant linear d 10 complexes of Cu, Ag and Au. Slippage is proposed to play a key role in catalytic reactions of alkenes through disruption and polarisation of the π‐system.

                "abstract": "Over the past few decades, researchers have made substantial progress in the development of transition metal complexes that activate and functionalize C–H bonds. For the most part, chemists have focused on aliphatic and aromatic C–H bonds and have put less effort into complexes that activate and functionalize vinylic C–H bonds. Our groups have recently developed a novel method to functionalize vinylic C–H bonds that takes advantage of the unique ligand-based reactivity of a rare class of metal dinitrosyl complexes. In this Account, we compare and discuss the chemistry of cobalt and ruthenium dinitrosyl complexes, emphasizing alkene binding, C–H functionalization, and catalysis.Initially discovered in the early 1970s by Brunner and studied more extensively in the 1980s by the Bergman group, the cyclopentadienylcobalt dinitrosyl complex CpCo(NO)2 reacts reversibly with alkenes to give, in many cases, stable and isolable cobalt dinitrosoalkane complexes. More recently, we found that treatment with strong bases, such as lithium hexamethyldisilazide, Verkade's base, and phosphazene bases, deprotonates these complexes and renders them nucleophilic at the carbon α to the nitroso group. This conjugate anion of metal dinitrosoalkanes can participate in conjugate addition to Michael acceptors to form new carbon–carbon bonds. These functionalized cobalt complexes can further react through alkene exchange to furnish the overall vinylic C–H functionalized organic product. This stepwise sequence of alkene binding, functionalization, and retrocycloaddition represents an overall vinylic C–H functionalization reaction of simple alkenes and does not require directing groups. We have also developed an asymmetric variant of this reaction sequence and have used this method to synthesize C1- and C2-symmetric diene ligands with high enantioinduction. Building upon these stepwise reactions, we eventually developed a simple one-pot procedure that uses stoichiometric amounts of a cobalt dinitrosoalkane complex for both inter- and intramolecular C–H functionalization. We can achieve catalysis in one-pot intramolecular reactions with a limited range of substrates.Our groups have also reported an analogous ruthenium dinitrosyl complex. In analogy to the cobalt complex, this ruthenium complex reacts with alkenes in the presence of neutral bidentate ligands, such as TMEDA, to give octahedral dinitrosoalkane complexes. Intramolecular functionalization or cyclization of numerous ruthenium dinitrosoalkane complexes proceeds under mild reaction conditions to give the functionalized organic products in excellent yields. However, despite extensive efforts, so far we have not been able to carry out intermolecular reactions of these complexes with a variety of electrophiles or C–H functionalization reactions.Although additional work is necessary to further boost the catalytic capabilities of both cobalt and ruthenium dinitrosyl complexes for vinylic C–H functionalization of simple alkenes, we believe this ligand-based vinylic C–H functionalization reaction has provided chemists with a useful set of tools for organic synthesis.",

The addition of the main group hydride to a toluene-solvated Cu(I) complex results in reversible ligand exchange, and the Cu(I) σ-complexes have been crystallized. Experimental and computational data provide a wealth of evidence for weak binding of the E–H bond to Cu(I), which can be ascribed to σ-donation from the E–H bond into the 4s orbital of copper and back-donation from copper into the E–H σ* orbital.",

                "abstract": "A series of copper(I) complexes bearing electron-deficient β-diketiminate ligands have been prepared. The study includes [{{ArNC(CR3)}2CH}Cu(η2-toluene)n] (Ar = Mes, R = F, n = 0.5, [12·tol]; Ar = C6F5, R = Me, n = 1, [2·tol]; Ar = 2,6-Cl2C6H3, R = H, n = 0.5, [32·tol]). Reactions of [1-3n·tol] with boranes, alanes, a zinc hydride, a magnesium hydride, and a calcium hydride generate the corresponding σ complexes ([1-3·B], [3·B'], [3·Al], [3·Al'], [1-3·Zn], [1·Mg], and [1·Ca]). These species all form reversibly, being in equilibrium with the arene solvates in solution. With the exception of the calcium complex, the complexes have all been characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. In solution, the σ-hydride of the aluminum, zinc, magnesium, and calcium derivatives resonates between -0.12 and -1.77 ppm (C6D6 or toluene-d8, 193-298 K). For the σ-borane complexes, the hydrides are observed as a single resonance between 2 and 3.5 ppm (C6D6, 298 K) and bridging and terminal hydrides rapidly exchange on the NMR time scale even at 193 K. Quantification of the solution dynamics by van't Hoff analysis yields expectedly small values of ΔH° and negative values of ΔS° consistent with weak binding and a reversible process that does not involve aggregation of the copper species. The donor-acceptor complexes can be rationalized in terms of the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model. Density functional theory calculations show that the donation of σ-M-H (or E-H) electrons into the 4s-based orbital (LUMO or LUMO+1) of the copper fragment is accompanied by weak back-donation from a dxz-based orbital (HOMO or HOMO-1) into the σ*-M-H (or E-H) orbital.",

While reversible C–H bond activation of the cyclometalated ligand was observed in stoichiometric experiments, D-labeling experiments and DFT calculations suggest that reversible ligand activation is not involved in silazane formation under catalytic conditions. We suggest that the extended reaction scope with the four-coordinate yttrium phosphonium methylide complex relative to the three-coordinate yttrium (tris)amide complex is a result of differences in the ease of amine inhibition of catalysis.",

The reaction sequence allows construction of a new C-C bond in a highly selective manner from a single sp3 C-F bond of a CF3 group in the presence of sp2 C-F bonds. The scope incorporates industrially relevant fluorocarbons including HFO-1234yf and HFO-1234ze. No catalyst, additives or transition metals are required, rather the methodology relies on a recently developed boron reagent. Remarkably, the boron site of this reagent plays a dual role in the reaction sequence, being nucleophilic at boron in the C-F cleavage step (SN 2') but electrophilic at boron en route to the carbon-carbon bond-forming step (SE 2'). The duplicitous behaviour is underpinned by a hydrogen atom migration from boron to the carbon atom of a carbene ligand.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Catalytic methods that transform C−H bonds into C−X bonds are of paramount importance in synthesis. A particular focus has been the generation of organoboranes, organosilanes and organostannanes from simple hydrocarbons (X=B, Si, Sn). Despite the importance of organozinc compounds (X=Zn), their synthesis by the catalytic functionalisation of C−H bonds remains unknown. Herein, we show that a palladium catalyst and zinc hydride reagent can be used to transform C−H bonds into C−Zn bonds. The new catalytic C−H zincation protocol has been applied to a variety of arenes—including fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, and benzene—with high chemo‐ and regioselectivity. A mechanistic study shows that heterometallic Pd–Zn complexes play a key role in catalysis. The conclusions of this work are twofold; the first is that valuable organozinc compounds are finally accessible by catalytic C−H functionalisation, the second is that heterometallic complexes are intimately involved in bond‐making and bond‐breaking steps of C−H functionalisation.",

Insight into the origin of chemoselectivity was obtained through a detailed mechanistic analysis (isolation of an intermediate, DFT studies, activation strain analysis).

These reactions are of potential relevance to the Fischer-Tropsch process, a technology that converts syngas (H2/CO) into mixtures of hydrocarbons. In this paper, a homogeneous model system that constructs carbon chains from CO is reported. The system exploits the cooperative effect of a transition metal complex and main group reductant. An entire reaction sequence from C1 → C2 → C3 → C4 has been synthetically verified. The scope of reactivity is broad and includes a variety of transition metals (M = Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Co), including those found in industrial heterogeneous Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. Variation of the transition metal fragment impacts the relative rate of the steps of chain growth, allowing isolation and structural characterisation of a rare C2 intermediate. The selectivity of carbon chain growth is also impacted by this variable; two distinct isomers of the C3 carbon chain were observed to form in different ratios with different transition metal reagents. Based on a combination of experiments (isotope labelling studies, study of intermediates) and calculations (DFT, NBO, ETS-NOCV) we propose a complete mechanism for chain growth that involves defined reactivity at both transition metal and main group centres.",

Further reaction of a heterometallic Cr-Mg formyl complex results in a rare example of C-C coupling and formation of an ethenediolate complex. DFT calculations support a key role for the formyl-intermediate in ethenediolate formation.

Cross-coupling results in the formation of an ethene amidolate ligand [OC1(H1)=C2(H2)NAr]2– a previously unknown entity which contains a 1,2-difunctionalised carbon chain reminiscent of those found in aminoalcohols and aminoacids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of such reactivity with metal hydride precursors. DFT calculations support a mechanism that parallels that established for coupling of CO to form ethenediolate ligands, with the key carbon–carbon bond step occurring by nucleophilic attack of a putative azamethylene intermediate on CO. The cluster plays a key role in templating the synthesis, providing kinetic control over each of the steps.

                "abstract": "Oxidative Addition involves the addition of a substrate to a metal centre. This reaction is fundamental across synthetic chemistry and underpins numerous catalytic methods. In the textbook description of oxidative addition reactions, charge flow predominately occurs from the metal centre to the substrate, leading to a net increase in the formal oxidation state of the metal; this occurs with simultaneous bond breaking at the substate. The majority of known reactions, however, involve substrates bearing relatively electronegative elements (e.g. H, C, N, O, halogen) and there has been little discussion of how addition processes may fundamentally change if substrates were constructed from more electropositive elements. Here we show that the zinc–zinc bonded complex, Cp*ZnZnCp*, which is isoelectronic with dihydrogen, undergoes facile addition to the metal (or semi-metal) centres of a series of main group carbene analogues based on aluminium, gallium, or silicon. Reactions proceed with complete breaking of the Zn–Zn bond and increase in the coordination number of the central metal from 2 to 4. Based of DFT calculations and reactivity, these addition processes are not oxidative. Rather data suggest that they are better described as a reductive addition, from the perspective of the main group centre. Our findings challenge our preconceptions regarding text-book definitions and hint that when involving electropositive substrates that oxidative addition processes may not always be oxidative.",

                "abstract": "The synthesis of a diverse series of hydride complexes of aluminium coordinated by N,N′-chelating ligands is reported. Reaction of [{2,6-iPr2C6H3}NC(Me)CHC(Me)N(H)CH2CH2NMe2] with either LiAlH4 or Me3N·AlH3 allows isolation of the corresponding five-coordinate aluminium dihydride [κ3-{(2,6-iPr2C6H3)NC(Me)CHC(Me)NCH2CH2NMe2}AlH2] (2). The latter complex demonstrates trigonal bipyramidal geometry in the solid-state. Correlation of solid and n-hexane solution infrared spectroscopy data reveals that this coordination is retained in solution. To evaluate the observed coordination geometry, the dissociation of the pendant ligand of 2 was investigated by DFT methods conducted with the M06-2X functional and a hybrid 6,31G+(d,p)/Lanl2DZ basis-set. Reaction of Me3N·AlH3 with both N,N′-bis(di-iso-propylphenyl)ethylenediamine and N,N′-bis(mesityl)ethylenediamine gave [{κ2-(ArNCH2)2}AlH(NMe3)] (Ar = Mes, 3a; Ar = 2,6-di-iso-propylphenyl, 3b) in moderate yields. Removal of NMe3 from 3b by heating under dynamic vacuum allowed the isolation of cis-[AlH{μ-N(Ar)CH2CH2N(Ar)}] (Ar = 2,6-di-iso-propylphenyl, cis-4b22) as a single diastereomer following crystallization. DFT studies in combination with infrared and NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction data provide a weight of evidence consistent with the robust dimeric structure of cis-4b22 remaining intact in solution. An unusual reaction in which the aluminium dihydride, [κ2-{(2,6-Me2C6H3NHCH2)2CH}AlH2], promotes the P–C bond cleavage of Ph3PCH2 is also reported.",

                "abstract": "The reaction of a series of M·Zr heterobimetallic hydride complexes with dienes and alkynes has been investigated (M = Al, Zn, and Mg). Reaction of M·Zr with 1,5-cyclooctadiene led to diene isomerization to 1,3-cyclooctadiene, but for M = Zn also result in an on-metal diene-to-alkyne isomerization. The resulting cyclooctyne fragment is trapped between Zr and Zn metals in a heterobimetallic species that does not form for M = Mg or Al. The scope of diene isomerization and alkyne trapping has been explored leading to the isolation of three new heterobimetallic slipped metallocyclopropene complexes. The mechanism of diene-to-alkyne isomerization was investigated through kinetics. While the reaction is first-order in Zn·Zr at high diene concentration and proceeds with ΔH‡ = +33.6 ± 0.7 kcal mol–1, ΔS‡ = +23.2 ± 1.7 cal mol–1 K–1, and ΔG⧧298 K = +26.7 ± 1.2 kcal mol–1, the rate is dependent on the nature of the diene. The positive activation entropy is suggestive of involvement of a dissociative step. On the basis of DFT calculations, a heterobimetallic rebound mechanism for diene-to-alkyne isomerization has been proposed. This mechanism explains the origin of heterobimetallic control over selectivity: Mg---Zr complexes are too strongly bound to generate reactive fragments, while Al---Zr complexes are too weakly bound to compensate for the contrathermodynamic isomerization process. Zn---Zr complexes have favorable energetics for both dissociation and trapping steps.",

Changing the main-group fragment of the M·Ru-N2 (M = Al, Zn, Mg) complexes can subtly alter the degree of binding, and therefore activation, of the diatomic ligand, as evidenced by the νN≡N absorptions in the infrared data. Experimental and computational data rationalize this tunable binding; decreasing the electronegativity of the main group in the order Al > Zn > Mg infers greater ionic character of these M·Ru-N2 complexes, and this in turn results in greater destabilization of the frontier molecular orbitals of ruthenium and therefore greater Ru(4d) → π*(N2) back-donation.",

The [B=C] − moiety is isoelectronic with the C=C system of an alkene. Comparison across the series shows that in the solid‐state, deviation between the η 2 and η 1 coordination mode occurs. A related zinc complex containing two [B=C] − ligands was prepared as a further point of comparison for the η 1 coordination mode. The bonding in these new complexes has been interrogated by computational techniques (QTAIM, NBO, ETS‐NOCV) and rationalised in terms of the Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model. The combined structural and computational data provide unique insight into catalytically relevant linear d 10 complexes of Cu, Ag and Au. Slippage is proposed to play a key role in catalytic reactions of alkenes through disruption and polarisation of the π‐system. Through the preparation and analysis of a consistent series of group 11 complexes, we show that variation of the metal can impact the coordination mode and hence substrate activation.",

This model predicts that metalation should occur exclusively at the 2-position of the heterocycle. While related 2-metalated furans are known to undergo a ring-expansion reaction, further calculations suggest that the thiophene-derived organoaluminum compounds should be both kinetically and thermodynamically stable with respect to ring opening. This model is supported by experimental data. Selective C–H alumination of thiophene, 2-methylthiophene, 2-methoxythiophene, and benzothiophene was achieved using [Pd(PCy3)2] as a catalyst with loadings as low as 0.02 mol %. Even under extremely forcing conditions (200 °C) there was no evidence for a ring-opening event. The differences in selectivity between furan and thiophene systems are rationalized in terms of the stabilization of a key intermediate (and transition state) in the pathway for furan ring opening by a strong dative O→Al interaction.",

The method leads to a simple and sustainable approach to generate difluoroalkanes and tolerates numerous sensitive functional groups including halogen, protected amine, ester and thiophene substituents. BF3-OEt2 catalyses this new catalytic transformation. Mechanistic studies (DFT, probe experiments) suggest the catalyst is intimately involved in both the defluorination and fluorination steps required for HF transfer, with BF3 acting as a Lewis acid and OEt2 a weak Lewis base that mediates proton transfer. Fluoroalkenes are demonstrated as competent intermediates and their conversion to difluoroalkanes was found to be reversible.

For M=Cr, a single stereoisomer is observed in solution and the solid-state. For M=Mo and W, cis and trans isomers were found to reversibly interconvert at 297 K. Despite the huge steric demands of the ligand on zinc, the cis isomer was found to be the most thermodynamically stable in all cases. The activation parameters for the isomerisation when M=Mo are ΔH≠ =20.8 kcal mol-1 and ΔS≠ =-12.8 cal K-1 mol-1 . In combination with DFT calculations, the negative activation entropy suggests an intramolecular rotation mechanism for isomerisation.",

DFT studies support a low-energy Ru(II)/Ru(IV) pathway for C-O bond activation: oxidative addition of the C-O bond to Ru(II) occurs in an asynchronous manner with Ru-C bond formation preceding C-O bond breaking. Alternative pathways based on a Ru(0)/Ru(II) couple are competitive but less accessible due to the high energy of the Ru(0) precursors. Both experimentally and by DFT calculations, sp2C-H bond activation is shown to be more facile than sp2C-O bond activation. The kinetic preference for C-H bond activation over C-O activation is attributed to unfavorable approach of the C-O bond toward the metal in the selectivity determining step of the reaction pathway.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Catalytic methods that transform C−H bonds into C−X bonds are of paramount importance in synthesis. A particular focus has been the generation of organoboranes, organosilanes and organostannanes from simple hydrocarbons (X=B, Si, Sn). Despite the importance of organozinc compounds (X=Zn), their synthesis by the catalytic functionalisation of C−H bonds remains unknown. Herein, we show that a palladium catalyst and zinc hydride reagent can be used to transform C−H bonds into C−Zn bonds. The new catalytic C−H zincation protocol has been applied to a variety of arenes—including fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, and benzene—with high chemo‐ and regioselectivity. A mechanistic study shows that heterometallic Pd–Zn complexes play a key role in catalysis. The conclusions of this work are twofold; the first is that valuable organozinc compounds are finally accessible by catalytic C−H functionalisation, the second is that heterometallic complexes are intimately involved in bond‐making and bond‐breaking steps of C−H functionalisation.",

While the reversibility of this process prevented isolation of [PdMg2 H4 ], analogous [PtMg2 H4 ] and [PtZn2 H4 ] complexes could be isolated and characterised through independent syntheses. Computational analysis (DFT, AIM, NCIPlot) of the bonding in a series of heterometallic tetrahydride compounds (Ni-Pt; Mg and Zn) suggests that these complexes are best described as square planar with marginal metal-metal interactions; the strength of which increases slightly as group 10 is descended and increases from Mg to Zn.

Here we report the C–H activation of styrenes by a well-defined bimetallic Fe–Al complex. These reactions are highly selective resulting in the (E)-β-metalation of the alkene. For this bimetallic system, alkene binding appears to be essential for the reaction to occur. Experimental and computational insight suggests an unusual reaction pathway in which a (2+2) cycloaddi-tion intermediate is directly converted into the hydrido vinyl product via an intramolecular sp2 C–H bond activation across the two metals. The key C–H cleavage step proceeds through a highly asynchronous transition state near the boundary be-tween a concerted/stepwise mechanism influenced by the resonance stabilization ability of the aryl substituent.",

The method tolerates numerous sensitive functional groups including halogen, protected amine, ester and thiophene substituents. Mechanistic studies (DFT, probe experiments) suggest the catalyst is involved in both the defluorination and fluorination steps, with BF 3 acting as a Lewis acid and OEt 2 a weak Lewis base that mediates proton transfer. In certain cases, the interconversion of fluoroalkene and difluoroalkane products was found to be reversible.

In conclusion, the divergent reactivity can be attributed to differences in both the symmetry and radial extension of the frontier molecular orbitals of the aluminum(I) fragment compared to that of common transition metal fragments.",

                "abstract": "The activation of C-C σ-bonds within strained three- and four-membered hydrocarbons at electrophilic Mg and Zn centres is reported. This was achieved in a two-step process involving (i) hydrometallation of a methylidene cycloalkane followed by (ii) intramolecular C-C bond activation. While hydrometallation of methylidene cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane and cyclohexane occurs for both Mg and Zn reagents, the C-C bond activation step is sensitive to ring size. For Mg, both cyclopropane and cyclobutane rings participate in C-C bond activation. For Zn, only the smallest cyclopropane ring reacts. These findings were used to expand the scope of catalytic hydrosilylation of C-C σ-bonds to include cyclobutane rings. The mechanism of C-C σ-bond activation was investigated through kinetic analysis (Eyring), spectroscopic observation of intermediates, and a comprehensive series of DFT calculations, including activation strain analysis. Based on our current understanding, C-C bond activation is proposed to occur by a β-alkyl migration step. β-Alkyl migration is more facile for more strained rings and occurs with lower barriers for Mg compared to Zn. Relief of ring strain is a key factor in determining the thermodynamics of C-C bond activation, but not in stabilising the transition state for β-alkyl migration. Rather, we ascribe the differences in reactivity to the stabilising interaction between the metal centre and the hydrocarbon ring-system, with the smaller rings and more electropositive metal (Mg) leading to a smaller destabilisation interaction energy as the transition state is approached. Our findings represent the first example of C-C bond activation at Zn and provide detailed new insight into the factors at play in β-alkyl migration at main group centres.",

The mechanism of this reaction has been probed through stoichiometric experiments and DFT calculations. The combined evidence suggests that H2 activation occurs by addition across the Zn–N bond via a four-membered transition state in which the Zn and N atoms play a dual role of Lewis acid and Lewis base. The zinc hydride complex that results from H2 addition, has been shown to be remarkably effective for the hydrozincation of C=C bonds at modest temperatures. The scope of hy-drozincation includes alkynes, alkenes, and a 1,3-butadiyne. For alkynes, the hydrozincation step is stereospecific leading exclusively to the syn-isomer. Competition experiments show that the hydrozincation of alkynes is faster than the equivalent alkene substrates. These new discoveries have been used to develop an unprecedented catalytic sys-tem for the semi-hydrogenation of alkynes. The catalytic scope includes both aryl and alkyl substituted internal al-kynes and proceeds with high alkene : alkane (96 : 4) and Z : E ratios (&gt;91 : 9). This work offers a first example of selective hydrogenation catalysis using zinc complexes.",

Despite nearly 20 years since its initial report, a mechanistic understanding of this system remains incomplete. Here we use automation, kinetic analysis, and DFT calculations to develop a new mechanistic model for this best-in-class catalyst. We show that a combination of the migratory insertion step and dihydrogen activation step are likely involved in the turnover-limiting sequence. The reaction kinetics are responsive to the nature of the substrate, with electron-rich aryl bromides reacting faster and more selectively than their electron-poor counterparts due to the influence of electronics in the migratory insertion step.

                "abstract": "A series of molecular boron, aluminium, and gallium difluoride complexes [{(ArNCMe)2CH}MF2] (M = B, Al, Ga) are reported as catalysts for the defluorofunctionalisation of electron-deficient arenes. Thiodefluorination reactions between TMS–SPh and poly(fluorinated aromatics) proceed with group 13 catalysis under forcing conditions. Evidence is presented for the fluoride entering the catalytic cyclic through a metathesis reaction with TMS–SPh to form metal thiolate intermediates, e.g. [{(ArNCMe)2CH}MF(SPh)], that are then competent nucleophiles for addition to the aromatic substrate, likely through a cSNAr mechanism. Attempts to expand the scope of reactivity to include the hydrodefluorination of electron-deficient arenes with the same group 13 difluoride catalysts met with limited success. Activity could, however, be recovered through addition of NaBArF4 as a catalytic additive (ArF = 3,5-C6H3(CF3)2). NMR titrations suggest that NaBArF4 is capable of coordinating to aluminium and gallium fluoride complexes, most likely through weak M–F---Na interactions (M = Al, Ga) and can play a role in lowering the barrier of metathesis between [{(ArNCMe)2CH}MF2] and Et3SiH to form the group 13 hydrido fluoride [{(ArNCMe)2CH}M(H)F], facilitating catalytic turnover. DFT calculations indicate this weak interaction, leads to a polarization of the M–F bond. The discovery of this additive effect has potentially broad implications in developing new reactivity and applications of thermodynamically stable metal–fluorides.",

                "abstract": "Trifluoromethane (HCF3) is a byproduct of fluoropolymer production that has limited applications. It is often stored or destroyed at the point of production, but if released into the environment is a potent greenhouse gas with global warming potential of 14,600 times that of CO2. State-of-the-art chemical technologies for upgrading HCF3 typically occur with conservation of the CF3 group. These approaches will come under increased scrutiny as concern over the environmental impact of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) continues to grow. A more sustainable approach involves synthetic transformations that repurpose the atomic content of HCF3 while also destroying the CF3 group. In this paper, we report a rare example of the transformation of HCF3 into a fluoroalkene functional group through defluoroalkylation. We rationalise product formation through DFT calculations, scale-up the synthesis through continuous flow methods, and show that a fluoroalkene reagent derived from HCF3 is a competent nucleophile for the fluoroethenylation of a range of aldehydes",

They are generated on scale (>1000 kg) through the palladium-catalyzed formylation of aryl bromides using syngas (CO/H2). The best-in-class catalyst system for this reaction employs di-1-adamantyl-n-butylphosphine (cataCXium A), palladium(II) acetate, and tetramethylethylenediamine. Despite nearly 20 years since its initial report, a mechanistic understanding of this system remains incomplete. Here, we use automation, kinetic analysis, and DFT calculations to develop a mechanistic model for this best-in-class catalyst. We suggest that a combination of the migratory insertion step and dihydrogen activation step is likely involved in the turnover-limiting sequence. The reaction kinetics are responsive to the nature of the substrate, with electron-rich aryl bromides reacting faster and more selectively than their electron-poor counterparts due to the influence of electronics in the migratory insertion step. Our findings add additional insight into the proposed mechanism of palladium-catalyzed formylation of aryl bromides.",

These calculations reveal that these ligands are strong σ-donors but also competent π-acceptors. These properties are not fixed but vary in response to the nature of the transition metal centre, suggesting that aluminylene fragments can modulate their bonding to accommodate both electron-rich and electron-poor transition metals. Ab initio DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations show that dispersion plays an important role in stabilising these complexes. Both short-range and long-range dispersion interactions are identified.

Several distinct mechanisms for C–C bond activation at main group metals have been proposed, with the key C–C bond activation step occurring by (i) beta-alkyl elimination, (ii) alpha-alkyl elimination, (iii) oxidative addition, or (iv) an electrocyclic reaction. Many of the known pathways involve an overall 2-electron redox process. Despite this, the direct oxidative addition of C–C bonds to main group metals is relatively rare, instead most reactions occur through initial installation of the main group site on a hydrocarbon scaffold (e.g. by a cycloaddition reaction or hydrometallation) followed by an -alkyl or -alkyl elimination step. Emerging applications of main group metal complexes as catalysts for the functionalisation of C–C bonds are also discussed.",

                "abstract": "Over the past few decades, numerous model systems have been discovered that create carbon–carbon bonds from CO. These reactions are of potential relevance to the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) process, a technology that converts syngas mixtures (H2/CO) into mixtures of hydrocarbons. In this paper, a new homogeneous model system that constructs carbon chains from CO is reported. The system exploits the cooperative effect of a transition metal complex and main group reductant. An entire reaction sequence from C1 to C2 to C3 to C4 has been synthetically verified. The scope of reactivity is broad and includes a variety of transition metals (M = Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Co), including those found in industrial heterogeneous F-T catalysts. Variation of the transition metal fragment impacts the relative rate of the steps of chain growth, allowing isolation and structural characterisation of a rare C2 intermediate. The selectivity of carbon chain growth is also impacted by this variable; two distinct isomers of the C3 carbon chain were observed to form in different ratios with different transition metal reagents. Based on a combination of experiments (isotope labelling studies, study of intermediates) and calculations (DFT, NBO, ETS-NOCV) we propose a complete mechanism for chain growth that involves defined reactivity at both transition metal and main group centres.",

This model predicts metalation should occur exclusively at the 2-position of the heterocycle. While related 2-metallated furans are known to undergo a ring-expansion reactions, further calculations suggest that the thiophene-derived organoaluminium compounds should be both kinetically and thermodynamically stable with respect to ring-opening. This model is supported by experimental data. Selective C–H alumination of thiophene, 2-methylthiophene, 2-methoxythiophene, and benzothiophene was achieved using [Pd(PCy3)2] as a catalyst with loadings as low as 0.02 mol%. Even under extremely forcing conditions (200 ºC) there was no evidence for a ring-opening event. The differences in selectivity between furan and thiophene systems are rationalised in terms of the stabilisation of a key intermediate (and transition state) in the pathway for furan ring opening by a strong dative O–Al interaction.",

While the reversibility of this process prevented isolation of [PdMg 2 H 4 ], analogous [PtMg 2 H 4 ] and [PtZn 2 H 4 ] complexes could be isolated and characterised through independent syntheses. Computational analysis (DFT, AIM, NCIPlot) of the bonding in a series of heterometallic tetrahydride compounds (Ni–Pt; Mg and Zn) suggests that these complexes are best described as square planar with marginal metal‐metal interactions; the strength of which increases slightly as group 10 is descended and increases from Mg to Zn. DFT calculations support a mechanism for H 2 activation involving a ligand‐assisted oxidative addition to Pd. These findings were exploited to develop a catalytic protocol for H/D exchange into magnesium hydride and zinc hydride bonds.",

                "abstract": "Non-catalysed and catalysed reactions of aluminium reagents with furans, dihydrofurans and dihydropyrans were investigated and lead to the ring-expanded products due to the formal insertion of the aluminium reagent into a C–O bond of the heterocycle. Specifically, the reaction of [{(ArNCMe)2CH}Al] (Ar = 2,6-di-iso-propylphenyl, 1) with furan, 2-methylfuran, 2,3-dimethylfuran and 2-methoxyfuran proceeded between 25 and 80 ºC leading to ring-expanded and dearomatised products due to the net transformation of a sp2 C–O bond into a sp2 C–Al bond. The kinetics of the reaction of 1 with furan were found to be 1st order with respect to 1 with activation parameters ΔH‡ = +19.7 (± 2.7) kcal mol-1, ΔS‡ = –18.8 (± 7.8) cal K-1 mol-1 and ΔG‡298 K = +25.3 (± 0.5) kcal mol-1 and a KIE of 1.0 ± 0.1. DFT calculations support a stepwise mechanism involving an initial (4+1) cycloaddition of 1 with furan to form a bicyclic intermediate that rearranges by an a-migration. The selectivity of ring-expansion is influenced by factors that weaken the sp2 C–O bond through population of the s*-orbital. Inclusion of [Pd(PCy3)2] as a catalyst in these reactions results in expansion of the substrate scope to include 2,3-dihydrofurans and 3,4-dihydropyrans but also improves the selectivity. Under catalysed conditions, the C–O bond that breaks is that adjacent to C–H bond. The aluminium(III) dihydride reagent [{(MesNCMe)2CH}AlH2] (Mes = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl, 2) can also be used under catalytic conditions to effect a dehydrogenative ring-expansion of furans. Further mechanistic analysis of the Pd-catalysed reaction of 1 with furan shows that C–O bond functionalisation occurs via an initial C–H bond alumination. Kinetic products can be isolated that are derived from installation of the aluminium reagent at the 2-position of the heterocycle. C–H alumination proceeds with a strong primary KIE of 4.8 ± 0.3 consistent with a turnover limiting step involving oxidative addition of the C–H bond to a palladium catalyst. Isomerisation of the kinetic C–H aluminated product to the thermodynamic C–O ring expansion product is an intramolecular process that is again catalysed by [Pd(PCy3)2]. DFT calculations suggest that the key C–O bond breaking step involves attack of an aluminium based metalloligand on the 2-palladated heterocycle. The new methodology has been applied to the upgrading of molecules derived from furfuraldehyde, an important platform chemical from biomass.",

The catalytic protocol results in the transformation of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; C–F bonds to sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; C–Al bonds and provides a route into reactive organoaluminium complexes (&lt;b&gt;2a-h&lt;/b&gt;) from fluorocarbons. The catalyst is highly active. Reactions proceed within 5 minutes at 25 ºC (and at appreciable rates at even –50 ºC) and the scope includes low-fluorine-content substrates such as fluorobenzene, difluorobenzenes and trifluorobenzenes. The reaction proceeds with complete chemoselectivity (C–F vs C–H) and high regioselectivities ( &gt;90% for C–F bonds adjacent to the most acidic C–H sites). The heterometallic complex [Pd(PCy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] was shown to be catalytically competent. Catalytic C–F alumination proceeds with a KIE of 1.1–1.3. DFT calculations have been used to model potential mechanisms for C–F bond activation. These calculations suggest that two competing mechanisms may be in operation. Pathway 1 involves a ligand-assisted oxidative addition to [Pd(&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and leads directly to the product. Pathway 2 involves a stepwise C–H to C–F functionalisation mechanism in which the C–H bond is broken and reformed along the reaction coordinate, allowing it to act as a directing group for the adjacent C–F site. This second mechanism explains the experimentally observed regioselectivity. Experimental support for this C–H activation playing a key role in C–F alumination was obtained by employing [{(MesNCMe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH}AlH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, Mes = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) as a reagent in place of 1. In this instance, the kinetic C–H alumination intermediate could be isolated. Under catalytic conditions this intermediate converts to the thermodynamic C–F alumination product.",

                "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we report BF 3 ⋅ OEt 2 as a catalyst to shuttle equivalents of HF from a fluoroalkane to an alkyne. Reactions of terminal and internal aliphatic alkynes led to formation of difluoroalkane products, while diarylalkynes can be selectively converted into fluoroalkenes. The method tolerates numerous sensitive functional groups including halogen, protected amine, ester and thiophene substituents. Mechanistic studies (DFT, probe experiments) suggest the catalyst is involved in both the defluorination and fluorination steps, with BF 3 acting as a Lewis acid and OEt 2 a weak Lewis base that mediates proton transfer. In certain cases, the interconversion of fluoroalkene and difluoroalkane products was found to be reversible. The new catalytic system was applied to demonstrate proof‐of‐concept recycling of poly(vinylidene difluoride).",

Eyring analysis allowed determination of the Gibbs activation energy of the back-reaction, CO elimination reaction with G‡298K = 26.6 ±3.0 kcal mol-1. Computational studies reveal a highly asynchronous, but concerted, transition state for CO insertion. The coordination of CO to aluminium precedes C–C bond formation.

                "abstract": "Non-catalysed and catalysed reactions of aluminium reagents with furans, dihydrofurans and dihydropyrans were investigated and lead to the ring-expanded products due to the formal insertion of the aluminium reagent into a C–O bond of the heterocycle. Specifically, the reaction of [{(ArNCMe)2CH}Al] (Ar = 2,6-di-iso-propylphenyl, 1) with furan, 2-methylfuran, 2,3-dimethylfuran and 2-methoxyfuran proceeded between 25 and 80 ºC leading to ring-expanded and dearomatised products due to the net transformation of a sp2 C–O bond into a sp2 C–Al bond. The kinetics of the reaction of 1 with furan were found to be 1st order with respect to 1 with activation parameters ΔH‡ = +19.7 (± 2.7) kcal mol-1, ΔS‡ = –18.8 (± 7.8) cal K-1 mol-1 and ΔG‡298 K = +25.3 (± 0.5) kcal mol-1 and a KIE of 1.0 ± 0.1. DFT calculations support a stepwise mechanism involving an initial (4+1) cycloaddition of 1 with furan to form a bicyclic intermediate that rearranges by an a-migration. The selectivity of ring-expansion is influenced by factors that weaken the sp2 C–O bond through population of the s*-orbital. Inclusion of [Pd(PCy3)2] as a catalyst in these reactions results in expansion of the substrate scope to include 2,3-dihydrofurans and 3,4-dihydropyrans but also improves the selectivity. Under catalysed conditions, the C–O bond that breaks is that adjacent to C–H bond. The aluminium(III) dihydride reagent [{(MesNCMe)2CH}AlH2] (Mes = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl, 2) can also be used under catalytic conditions to effect a dehydrogenative ring-expansion of furans. Further mechanistic analysis of the Pd-catalysed reaction of 1 with furan shows that C–O bond functionalisation occurs via an initial C–H bond alumination. Kinetic products can be isolated that are derived from installation of the aluminium reagent at the 2-position of the heterocycle. C–H alumination proceeds with a strong primary KIE of 4.8 ± 0.3 consistent with a turnover limiting step involving oxidative addition of the C–H bond to a palladium catalyst. Isomerisation of the kinetic C–H aluminated product to the thermodynamic C–O ring expansion product is an intramolecular process that is again catalysed by [Pd(PCy3)2]. DFT calculations suggest that the key C–O bond breaking step involves attack of an aluminium based metalloligand on the 2-palladated heterocycle. The new methodology has been applied to the upgrading of molecules derived from furfuraldehyde, an important platform chemical from biomass.",

                "abstract": "A palladium pre-catalyst, [Pd(PCy 3 ) 2 ] is reported for the efficient and selective C–F alumination of fluorobenzenes with the aluminium(I) reagent [{(ArNCMe) 2 CH}Al] ( 1 , Ar = 2,6-di-iso-propylphenyl). The catalytic protocol results in the transformation of sp 2 C–F bonds to sp 2 C–Al bonds and provides a route into reactive organoaluminium complexes ( 2a-h ) from fluorocarbons. The catalyst is highly active. Reactions proceed within 5 minutes at 25 ºC (and at appreciable rates at even –50 ºC) and the scope includes low-fluorine-content substrates such as fluorobenzene, difluorobenzenes and trifluorobenzenes. The reaction proceeds with complete chemoselectivity (C–F vs C–H) and high regioselectivities ( &gt;90% for C–F bonds adjacent to the most acidic C–H sites). The heterometallic complex [Pd(PCy 3 )( 1 ) 2 ] was shown to be catalytically competent. Catalytic C–F alumination proceeds with a KIE of 1.1–1.3. DFT calculations have been used to model potential mechanisms for C–F bond activation. These calculations suggest that two competing mechanisms may be in operation. Pathway 1 involves a ligand-assisted oxidative addition to [Pd( 1 ) 2 ] and leads directly to the product. Pathway 2 involves a stepwise C–H to C–F functionalisation mechanism in which the C–H bond is broken and reformed along the reaction coordinate, allowing it to act as a directing group for the adjacent C–F site. This second mechanism explains the experimentally observed regioselectivity. Experimental support for this C–H activation playing a key role in C–F alumination was obtained by employing [{(MesNCMe) 2 CH}AlH 2 ] ( 3 , Mes = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) as a reagent in place of 1. In this instance, the kinetic C–H alumination intermediate could be isolated. Under catalytic conditions this intermediate converts to the thermodynamic C–F alumination product.",

                "abstract": "The reactions of transition metal complexes underpin numerous synthetic processes and catalytic transformations. Typically, this reactivity involves the participation of empty and filled molecular orbitals centred on the transition metal. Kinetically stabilised species, such as octahedral low-spin d6 transition metal complexes, are not expected to participate directly in these reactions. However, novel approaches that exploit metal ligand-cooperativity offer an opportunity to challenge these preconceptions. Here we show that inclusion of an aluminium-based ligand into the coordination sphere of neutral low-spin d6 iron complex leads to unexpected reactivity. Complexes featuring an unsupported Fe–Al bond are capable of the intermolecular C–H bond activation of pyridines. Mechanistic analysis suggests that C–H activation proceeds through a reductive deprotonation in which the two metal centres (Fe and Al) act like a frustrated Lewis-pair. Key to this behaviour is a ground state destabilisation of the d6 iron complex, brought about by the inclusion of the electropositive aluminium-based ligand. These findings have immediate implications for the design of reagents and catalysts based on 1st row transition metals.",

Mechanistic studies suggest that rather than occurring by a concerted oxidative addition, these reactions involve stepwise processes in which substrate binding to the main group metal acts as a precursor to a- or b-alkyl migration steps that break the C–C s-bond.

                "abstract": "The reversible activation of dihydrogen with a molecular zinc anilide complex is reported. The mechanism of this reaction has been probed through stoichiometric experiments and DFT calculations. The combined evidence suggests that H2 activation occurs by addition across the Zn–N bond via a four-membered transition state in which the Zn and N atoms play a dual role of Lewis acid and Lewis base. The zinc hydride complex that results from H2 addition, has been shown to be remarkably effective for the hydrozincation of C=C bonds at modest temperatures. The scope of hy-drozincation includes alkynes, alkenes, and a 1,3-butadiyne. For alkynes, the hydrozincation step is stereospecific leading exclusively to the syn-isomer. Competition experiments show that the hydrozincation of alkynes is faster than the equivalent alkene substrates. These new discoveries have been used to develop an unprecedented catalytic sys-tem for the semi-hydrogenation of alkynes. The catalytic scope includes both aryl and alkyl substituted internal al-kynes and proceeds with high alkene : alkane (&gt;91 : 9) and Z : E ratios (&gt;96 : 4). This work offers a first example of selective hydrogenation catalysis using zinc complexes.",

                "abstract": "The activation of C–C sigma-bonds within strained three- and four-membered hydrocarbons at electrophilic Mg and Zn centres is reported. This was achieved in a two-step process involving (i) hydrometallation of a methylidene cycloalkane followed by (ii) intramolecular C–C bond activation. While hydrometallation of methylidene cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane and cyclohexane occurs for both Mg and Zn reagents, the C–C bond activation step is sensitive to ring size. For Mg, both cyclopropane and cyclobutane rings participate in C–C bond activation. For Zn, only the smallest cyclopropane ring reacts. These findings were used to expand the scope of catalytic hydrosilylation of C–C -bonds to include cyclobutane rings. The mechanism of C–C sigma-bond activation was investigated through kinetic analysis (Eyring), spectroscopic observation of intermediates, and a comprehensive series of DFT calculations, including Activation Strain Analysis. Based on our current understanding, C–C bond activation is proposed to occur by beta-alkyl migration step. beta-Alkyl migration is more facile for more strained rings and occurs with lower barriers for Mg compared to Zn. Relief of ring strain is a key factor in determining the thermodynamics of C–C bond activation, but not in stabilising the transition state for beta-Alkyl migration. Rather we ascribe the differences in reactivity to the stabilising interaction between the metal centre and the hydrocarbon ring-system, with the smaller rings and more electropositive metal (Mg) leading to a less destabilisation interaction energy as the transition state is approached. Our findings represent the first example of C–C bond activation at Zn and provide detailed new insight into the factors at play in beta-alkyl migration at main group centres.",

These reactions are of potential relevance to the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) process, a technology that converts syngas mixtures (H2/CO) into mixtures of hydrocarbons. In this paper, a new homogeneous model system that constructs carbon chains from CO is reported. The system exploits the cooperative effect of a transition metal complex and main group reductant. An entire reaction sequence from C1 to C2 to C3 to C4 has been synthetically verified. The scope of reactivity is broad and includes a variety of transition metals (M = Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Co), including those found in industrial heterogeneous F-T catalysts. Variation of the transition metal fragment impacts the relative rate of the steps of chain growth, allowing isolation and structural characterisation of a rare C2 intermediate. The selectivity of carbon chain growth is also impacted by this variable; two distinct isomers of the C3 carbon chain were observed to form in different ratios with different transition metal reagents. Based on a combination of experiments (isotope labelling studies, study of intermediates) and calculations (DFT, NBO, ETS-NOCV) we propose a complete mechanism for chain growth that involves defined reactivity at both transition metal and main group centres.",

Such reactions require the development of new catalytic systems that can promote both defluorination and fluorination steps in a single reaction sequence. Herein, we report a novel catalytic protocol in which an equivalent of HF is generated from a perfluoroarene | nucleophile pair and transferred directly to an alkyne. The reaction is catalysed by [Au(IPr)NiPr2] (IPr = N,N’-1,3-Bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene) and is 100 % atom efficient. HF transfer generates two useful products in the form of functionalised fluoroarenes and fluoroalkenes. Mechanistic studies (rate laws, KIEs, DFT calculations, competition experiments) are consistent with the Au(I) catalyst facilitating a catalytic network involving both concerted SNAr and hydrofluorination steps. The nature of the nucleophile impacts the turnover-limiting step. The cSNAr step is turnover-limiting for phenol-based nucleophiles while proteodeauration likely becomes turnover-limiting for aniline-based nucleophiles. The new approach removes the need for direct handling of HF reagents in hydrofluorination and offers new possibilities to manipulate the fluorine content of organic molecules through catalysis.",

                "abstract": "&lt;i&gt;The synthesis and spectroscopic characterisation of eight new first-row transition metal (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu) aluminylene complexes is reported. DFT and ab&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;initio calculations have been used to provide detailed insight into the metal–metal bond. The σ-donation and π-backdonation properties of the aluminylene ligand are evaluated via NBO and ETS-NOCV calculations. These calculations reveal that these ligands are strong σ-donors but also competent π-acceptors. These properties are not fixed but vary in response to the nature of the transition metal centre, suggesting that aluminylene fragments can modulate their bonding to accommodate both electron-rich and electron-poor transition metals. Ab initio&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations show that dispersion plays an important role in stabilising these complexes. Both short-range and long-range dispersion interactions are identified. These results will likely inform the design of next-generation catalysts based on aluminium metalloligands. &lt;/i&gt;",

                "abstract": "Re-distributed manufacturing presents a number of opportunities and challenges for New Product Development in a future Circular Economy. It has been argued that small-scale, flexible and localised production systems will reduce resource consumption, lower transport emissions and extend product lifetimes. At the same time smart products within the Internet of Things will gather and report data on user behaviour and product status. Many sustainable design tools have previously been developed but few are able to imagine and develop visions of how future sustainable product service systems might be manifested. This paper introduces the concept of Consumer Intervention Mapping as a tool for creating future product strategies. The tool visualises the points within a product’s lifecycle where stakeholders are able to intervene in the product’s expected journey. This perspective enables the rapid construction of scenarios that explore and describe future circular product service systems. Validation of the tool in three workshops is described and the outcomes are presented. Consumer Intervention Mapping is successful in creating scenarios that describe existing product service systems and new product concepts adapted to a Circular Economy paradigm. Further work is required to refine the tool’s performance in more focused and reflective design exercises.",

                "abstract": "This research aimed to develop a simple but robust method to identify the key barriers to the transition from a linear to a circular economy (CE) for end of life products or material. Nine top-tier barrier categories have been identified that influence this transition. These relate to the basic material properties and product characteristics, the availability of suitable processing technology, the environmental impacts associated with current linear management, the organizational context, industry and supply chain issues, external drivers, public perception, the regulatory framework and the overall economic viability of the transition. The method provides a novel and rapid way to identify and quantitatively assess the barriers to the development of CE products. This allows mitigation steps to be developed in parallel with new product design. The method has been used to assess the potential barriers to developing a circular economy for waste feathers generated by the UK poultry industry. This showed that transitioning UK waste feathers to circularity faces significant barriers across numerous categories and is not currently economically viable. The assessment method developed provides a novel approach to identifying barriers to circularity and has potential to be applied to a wide range of end of life materials and products.",

                "abstract": "Abstract Poultry has become the primary source of dietary protein consumed globally and as a result the by-product feathers are an increasingly problematic industrial waste. Developing a circular economy for feathers is, therefore, an important research area that provides an opportunity to make use of the unique combination of properties of this abundant natural material. This paper reports on the thermal properties of novel feather-based thermal insulation materials. Waste feathers were collected, cleaned and processed into fibres, which were then used to form air-laid nonwoven materials. These have a high fibre content and exploit the excellent natural thermal insulation properties of feathers. The performance of the novel materials developed are tested in order to outline the influence of temperature and density on thermal conductivity and dynamic water sorption. Results are compared to a range of commercially available thermal insulation materials for buildings manufactured from denim, hemp, sheep wool, PET and mineral wool. It was found that air laid feather-fibre fabrics have comparable performance to other fibrous materials and have a thermal conductivity of 0.033 W/(m K) for samples with a density of 59 kg/m 3 . This is due to the low thermal conductivity of feather fibres and the void structure formed by air-laid processing that effectively traps air. These materials additionally offer improved sustainability credentials as they are derived from a readily available waste that is generally considered to be unavoidable. The paper concludes by highlighting the significant technical and commercial barriers that exist to using waste feathers in thermal insulation products and suggests areas for further research that can exploit the unique properties of feathers.

Increasing evidence suggests the transition towards a sustainable society must consist of sustainable lifestyles, designed and owned by individual people and communities. This research builds upon a set of lifestyle scenarios set in the year 2050, derived from the SPREAD 2050 and EUInnovatE projects, in order to explore the use of speculative methods to enable designers and future citizen-designers to reflect upon their practices and enact more radical change. The authors developed design workshops to examine the potential of speculative design applied in practice as a tool for systems change. The results have shown promise as a method for influencing a change in mindset amongst designers, and suggest opportunities for future research investigating how artefacts of change can create pathways towards a sustainable society.",

                "abstract": "This research has investigated the use of feather fibres to produce sound absorption materials as an alternative to the oil derived synthetic plastics that currently dominate the sound absorption materials market. In this paper we show that clean and disinfected waste feathers from the poultry industry can be processed into fibres and air laid using commercial pilot plant facilities to form non-woven feather fibre composite mats. By varying the composition and processing conditions, materials with a range of different properties such as thickness and density were produced. The sound absorption coefficients of samples was determined using the impedance tube method (BS EN ISO 10534-2: 1998), using normal incidence sound between 80 and 1,600 Hz. The data reported shows that air laid non-woven feather fibre mats have improved sound absorption coefficients compared to other natural materials used for sound absorption for a given thickness, particularly in the problematic low frequency range between 250 to 800 Hz. We conclude that air laid non-woven feather fibres have high potential to be used as effective and sustainable sound absorption materials in aerospace, automotive, buildings, infrastructure and other applications where sound absorption is required.",

Established design processes are often unable to readily accommodate these rapid changes. In addition, incremental benefits are often achieved through existing sustainable design approaches due to inability to fully assess the impacts of product design improvements and their associated implications within production facilities. This highlights the need for more integrated design processes that enable seamless co-development of products and production systems. This paper examines the current interrelation and interaction of these design processes from the resource efficiency viewpoint, proposes a novel sustainable ‘Co-Design’ model, and discusses the ecological benefits of co-designing future products and production systems.",

The work forms part of the ‘Business as Unusual: Designing Products with Consumers in the Loop’ [BaU] project, funded as part of the UK EPSRC-ESRC RECODE network (RECODE, 2016) that aims to explore the potential of re-distributed manufacturing (RdM) in a context of sustainability. This element of the project employed interviews, mapping and workshops as methods to investigate the relationship between people and products across the product lifecycle. A focus on product longevity and specifically the people-product interactions is captured in conversations around product maintenance and repair. In exploring ideas of ‘broken’ we found different characteristics of, and motivations for, repair. Mapping these and other product-people interactions across the product lifecycle indicated where current activity is, who owns such activity (i.e. organisation or individual) and where gaps in interactions occur. These issues were explored further in a workshop which grouped participants to look at products from the perspective of one of four scenarios; each scenario represented either short or long product lifespans and different types of people engagement in the design process. The findings help give shape to new scenarios for designing sufficiency-based social models of material flows.",

                "abstract": "The research starts from the premise that as the world is changing rapidly and in nonlinear ways, we are educating future practitioners for jobs and contexts that don’t yet exist. They instead need to be equipped to work for and with uncertainty to be able to grapple with the scale and pace of emergent change. The fields of design and futures studies bring significant insights to this challenge, including an array of methods, tools, and frameworks for prospective and systemic explorations of alternative futures. The emerging field of design futures can be framed as ways to develop and deploy prompts, artifacts, and narratives to critically interrogate tomorrow’s societal debates today; as such, it is intentional from the outset in its pursuit of preferable futures and therefore social and environmental justice. The process of imagining the future is an active, values-laden social practice, which requires a layered approach to a methodology to surface and challenge dominant patterns—making it an ideal approach for training the young people who will shape our future. This article reports on the design and delivery of participatory workshops that employ design futures methods to facilitate the exploration of transformative change for sustainability. These workshops were conducted with young people aged sixteen to seventeen to equip them to develop and explore alternative futures. The results suggest that design futures methods can facilitate participants from non-design backgrounds to develop alternative futures and artifacts that might sit within them. It was found that developing a sense of ownership was key to enabling participants to effectively reflect on alternative futures and their implications. Finally, the study highlights the potential for these methods to inform both design and sustainability pedagogy.",

                "abstract": "Product customisation using online configurators is becoming increasingly popular. However, configurators can be difficult to use and can generate disappointing outcomes because they ask users to take on the role of 'designer' and imagine how their digital creation might look and work in the physical world. This paper presents an investigation into how mental imagery is used to evaluate products in virtual environments and how it influences the cognitive effort invested in the customisation process. Data were collected through survey questionnaires to assess users' mental imagery abilities and through contextual inquiry to understand the decision-making processes of users in configuring product attributes. The study found no significant correlation between the vividness of mental imagery or the frequency of its use in daily life, and the effort users invested in the mental imagery during digital product configuration process. The study further identified three types of visualisations utilised by users (product-related, user-related and scenario-related) and indicated that expending more effort in mental imagery could positively influence their confidence and satisfaction with the designed outcome. This study aids in understanding how users navigate digital product customisation, providing direct insight into more accurate communication with users. These insights will support the creation of a more user-centred experience, which in turn will enable the development of products that meet expectations and are therefore more likely to be enjoyed, utilised, and kept for a longer time.",

This study investigates established online garment customisation methods, to understand how the remote digital environment impacts customers' engagement with garment function, form and fit. Participants with previous garment customisation experience were asked to customise a shirt using an online configurator, and data was collected through in-depth interviews to understand customers' decision journeys and emotional responses toward a digitally configured product. The results indicate that, despite a positive experience in configuring appearance, customers' inability to visualise the customised garment on their body could result in less satisfaction with, and sense of ownership of, the designed digital outcome.",

In response, a great deal of research has been directed at the development of sustainable design methods, as early design intervention has the potential to generate radical improvements. At present however, sustainability is often considered as an afterthought, only yielding incremental improvements. As such there is a clear need to redesign our design processes, and promote embedded consideration of sustainability throughout from the earliest stages.\n\nThis thesis reports on research investigating how sustainability considerations could be systematically incorporated into product design processes through the definition of a framework and the development of a methodology for evaluating established design processes and identifying and prioritising stages for sustainability considerations to be embedded into design activity.

                "abstract": "Manufacturers are responsible for about one third of global energy demand, and thus have a responsibility for\nreducing their reliance on rapidly depleting non-renewable energy sources. Consequently, a plethora of\nresearch has arisen to develop novel ways of improving energy efficiency in factories by focusing on changes\nto energy intensive production processes and other energy using systems that support manufacturing\nactivities. However, the ultimate goal of manufacturing companies is to maximise profit by refining their\nbusiness strategy, highlighting the importance of assessing the impact of different business strategies on\nenergy demand. Therefore, one of the key research challenges is to assign anticipated energy demand to\nvarious decisions within a business. This paper presents a hierarchical approach to attribute the potential\nenergy demand of manufacturing activities to alternative business decisions, thus informing selection of the\nmost energy efficient business strategies.",

                "abstract": "This paper discusses how futures methods could be used to help emerging generations of designers and engineers to be better prepared for the demands of a rapidly changing future. Science and technology have a pivotal role in realising a better world; however, as the world changes increasingly rapidly, we are educating future engineers and designers for jobs and contexts that don’t yet exist. They instead need to be equipped to identify and exploit new opportunities by working across disciplines and considering multiple intervention points - from hard systems transitions, such as mobility or energy, to soft systems transitions, such as culture, identity or narratives. The fields of design pedagogy and futures studies bring significant insights to this challenge, including an array of methods, tools and frameworks for problem framing and problem solving through divergent and convergent thinking. This paper describes an intensive week-long workshop that used alternative futures as a prompt for teams of secondary school students (aged 16-17) with an interest in studying medicine, science and engineering. This week was part of Imperial College London’s Global Summer School and was one in a series of workshops run by the authors to build and test these methodologies by employing alternative futures to develop products for, and eventually in, the future. The results of this latest workshop suggest the potential for experiential learning to explore new ways of working and enable students to reflect and test their dominant assumptions about the future. Finally, the study highlighted the need for further research to better understand how students can embrace the dissonance between their stated preferred futures and the range of possible and probable futures.",

                "abstract": "This paper considers the planning, methodology and pitfalls in creating an educational collaboration in an international design project that deeply engages students in their new translocated context whilst avoiding surface-level engagement with the host community. Projects such as these offer many benefits to those involved, however could be accused of ‘Design Tourism’ - where the primary purpose of the project is the educational or personal development of the visitors, and the resulting ideas are left without any potential for realistic implementation. This problem is of critical importance for design and engineering educators who both want their students to learn and want their students’ projects to have genuine legacy and impact. This paper explores this tension, and how this relates to the role of the designer working and learning across local and globalised contexts, and the role of an educator in designing an appropriate and effective learning experience. Building upon a legacy of annual international design projects, this paper uses ‘GoGlobal Chile 2017’ as a case study. The context and educational design of the project are outlined, and the resulting projects are presented, where 74 designers from the United Kingdom and Chile worked together to develop a series of innovation projects exploring the topic of food security. This paper concludes by considering factors for creating successful international design projects through a focus on building team cohesiveness and setting appropriate student expectations of legacy. By balancing these factors, students can be empowered to co-create impactful, contextualised projects whilst developing key skills to collaborate internationally in the future.",

To answer this question, the study mapped the different product-people interactions to identify the challenges and opportunities for user engagement in design and manufacture, to further investigate their application in order to bridge the gap between users, companies and the products that they produce. To further analyse these opportunities, two different product-people interactions were delved into, to understand how new forms of engaging people across the life cycle can achieve a more localised and responsive structures of manufacturing and product adoption. The results of these investigations helped to envision four contrasting scenarios of BaU, and generate conceptual business models and touchpoints to support these novel systems of consumption and production.",

Chicken feathers are an industrial waste that can be used to form sustainable materials suitable for use in sound insulation applications. Clean and disinfected waste chicken feathers were processed into fibres and these were air laid using commercial pilot plant facilities to form non-woven feather fibre composite mats. Varying the composition and processing conditions produced mats with different density, thickness and weight per unit area. The sound absorption coefficients of the non-woven feather fibre composites were determined using the impedance tube method. The tests used normal incidence and were completed over the frequency range from 63 and 1,600 Hz. The performance of feather fibre mats were then compared to commercially available sound absorption products.",

We shall address this question for hybrid dynamical systems, defined as systems whose motion can be expressed as the composition of two or more Lie-group actions. Hybrid systems abound in fluid dynamics. Examples include: the dynamics of complex fluids such as liquid crystals; wind-driven waves propagating with the currents moving on the sea surface; turbulence modelling in fluids and plasmas; and classical-quantum hydrodynamic models in molecular chemistry. From among these examples, the motivating question here is: How do wind-driven waves produce ocean surface currents? The paper first summarises the geometric mechanics approach for deriving hybrid models of multiscale, multiphysics motions in ideal fluid dynamics. It then illustrates this approach for WMFI in the examples of 3D WKB waves and 2D wave amplitudes governed by the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation propagating in the frame of motion of an ideal incompressible inhomogeneous Euler fluid flow. The results for these examples tell us that the mean flow in WMFI does not create waves, although it does transport the waves. However, feedback in the opposite direction is possible, since the 3D WKB and 2D NLS wave dynamics discussed here do in fact create circulatory mean flow.",

Within this framework and the corresponding choice of constraints, the Euler-Poincare equation can be easily deduced. We show that their corresponding deterministic counterparts are particular cases of this class of stochastic variational principles. Moreover, this is a natural framework that enables us to correctly characterize the pressure term in incompressible stochastic fluid models. Other general constraints can also be incorporated as long as they are compatible with the driving semi-martingale.",

This coordination of gradients of fluid material properties with wave envelopes tends to occur when strong horizontal buoyancy gradients are present. The nonlinear models of this coordinated movement presented here may provide future opportunities for the optimal design of satellite imagery that could simultaneously capture the dynamics of both waves and currents directly. The model derived here appears in two levels of approximation: first for rapidly oscillating waves, and then for their slowly varying envelope (SVE) approximation obtained by using the WKB approach. The WKB wave-current-buoyancy interaction model derived here for a free surface with significant horizontal buoyancy gradients indicates that the mechanism for the emergence of these correlations is the ponderomotive force of the slowly varying envelope of rapidly oscillating waves acting on the surface currents via the horizontal buoyancy gradient. In this model, the buoyancy gradient appears explicitly in the WKB wave momentum, which in turn generates density-weighted potential vorticity whenever the buoyancy gradient is not aligned with the wave-envelope gradient.",

In doing so, we find a stochastic equation for the evolution of a velocity potential and, more significantly, demonstrate that the stochastic equations for water wave dynamics have a Hamiltonian structure which mirrors that found by Zakharov for the deterministic theory.

                "abstract": "Abstract The classical water wave equations (CWWEs) comprise two boundary conditions for the two‐dimensional flow on the free surface of a bulk three‐dimensional (3D) incompressible potential flow in the volume bounded by the free surface, which itself moves under the restoring force of gravity. One of these two boundary conditions provides the kinematic definition of the vertical velocity of the surface elevation. The other boundary condition is the dynamic Bernoulli law that governs the evaluation of the bulk velocity potential on the free surface. The present paper applies these two boundary conditions as constraints in the action integral for Hamilton's variational principle, along with a non‐hydrostatic pressure constraint that imposes incompressible flow on the free surface. The stationary variations in Hamilton's principle then yield closed dynamical equations of free surface flow whose divergence‐free velocity admits nonzero vorticity and whose nonhydrostatic pressure matches the pressure of the 3D bulk flow when evaluated on the free surface. A minimal coupling approach is proposed to model the mutual interactions of the waves and currents. The dynamical effects of horizontal buoyancy gradients are also considered in this context. For any combination of these model variables, the resulting system of variational equations admits a Lie–Poisson Hamiltonian formulation. Finally, stochastic versions of these model equations are derived by assuming that the material loop for their Kelvin circulation theorem in each case follows stochastic Lagrangian histories in a Stratonovich sense.",

We provide both deterministic and stochastic closure models for GLM IGWs at leading order in 3D complex vector WKB wave asymptotics.

                "abstract": "The recent interest in structure preserving stochastic Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems raises questions regarding how such models are to be understood and the principles through which they are to be derived. By considering a mathematically sound extension of the Hamilton-Pontryagin principle, we derive a stochastic analogue of the Euler-Lagrange equations, driven by independent semimartingales. Using this as a starting point, we can apply symmetry reduction carefully to derive non-canonical stochastic Lagrangian / Hamiltonian systems, including the stochastic Euler-Poincar\\'e / Lie-Poisson equations, studied extensively in the literature. Furthermore, we develop a framework to include dissipation that balances the structure-preserving noise in such a way that the overall stochastic dynamics preserves the Gibbs measure on the symplectic manifold, where the dynamics effectively take place. In particular, this leads to a new derivation of double-bracket dissipation by considering Lie group invariant stochastic dissipative dynamics, taking place on the cotangent bundle of the group.",

                "abstract": "How does one derive models of dynamical feedback effects in multiscale, multiphysics systems such as wave mean flow interaction (WMFI)? We shall address this question for hybrid dynamical systems, whose motion can be expressed as the composition of two or more Lie-group actions. Hybrid systems abound in fluid dynamics. Examples include: the dynamics of complex fluids such as liquid crystals; wind-driven waves propagating with the currents moving on the sea surface; turbulence modelling in fluids and plasmas; and classical-quantum hydrodynamic models in molecular chemistry. From among these examples, the motivating question in this paper is: How do wind-driven waves produce ocean surface currents? The paper first summarises the geometric mechanics approach for deriving hybrid models of multiscale, multiphysics motions in ideal fluid dynamics. It then illustrates this approach for WMFI in the examples of 3D WKB waves and 2D wave amplitudes governed by the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation propagating in the frame of motion of an ideal incompressible inhomogeneous Euler fluid flow. The results for these examples tell us that the fluid flow in WMFI does not create waves. However, feedback in the opposite direction is possible, since 3D WKB and 2D NLS wave dynamics can indeed create circulatory fluid flow.",

Following Gjaja and Holm 1996, we consider 3D inertial gravity waves (IGWs) in the EB approximation. The GLM closure for WKB IGWs expresses EB wave mean flow interaction (WMFI) as WKB wave motion boosted into the reference frame of the EB equations for the Lagrangian mean transport velocity. We provide both deterministic and stochastic closure models for GLM IGWs at leading order in 3D complex vector WKB wave asymptotics. This paper brings the Gjaja and Holm 1996 paper at leading order in wave amplitude asymptotics into an easily understood short form and proposes a stochastic generalisation of the WMFI equations for IGWs.",

Moreover, their wave dynamics does not cause circulation of the fluid velocity on the free surface. The equations for free-surface motion we derive here are closed and they are not restricted to potential flow. Hence, true wave-current interaction dynamics can occur. In particular, the Kelvin-Noether theorem demonstrates that wave activity can induce fluid circulation and vorticity dynamics on the free surface. The wave-current interaction equations introduced here open new vistas for both the deterministic and stochastic analysis of nonlinear waves on free surfaces.",

                "abstract": "The mathematical models and numerical simulations reported here are motivated by satellite observations of horizontal gradients of sea surface temperature and salinity that are closely coordinated with the slowly varying envelope of the rapidly oscillating waves. This coordination of gradients of fluid material properties with wave envelopes tends to occur when strong horizontal buoyancy gradients are present. The nonlinear models of this coordinated movement presented here may provide future opportunities for the optimal design of satellite imagery that could simultaneously capture the dynamics of both waves and currents directly. The model derived here appears in two levels of approximation: first for rapidly oscillating waves, and then for their slowly varying envelope (SVE) approximation obtained by using the WKB approach. The WKB wave-current-buoyancy interaction model derived here for a free surface with significant horizontal buoyancy gradients indicates that the mechanism for the emergence of these correlations is the ponderomotive force of the slowly varying envelope of rapidly oscillating waves acting on the surface currents via the horizontal buoyancy gradient. In this model, the buoyancy gradient appears explicitly in the WKB wave momentum, which in turn generates density-weighted potential vorticity whenever the buoyancy gradient is not aligned with the wave-envelope gradient.",

In doing so, we find a stochastic equation for the evolution of a velocity potential and, more significantly, demonstrate that the stochastic equations for water wave dynamics have a Hamiltonian structure which mirrors that found by Zakharov for the deterministic theory.
